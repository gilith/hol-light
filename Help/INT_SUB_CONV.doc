\DOC INT_SUB_CONV

\TYPE {INT_SUB_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Conversion to perform subtraction on two integer literals of type {:int}.

\DESCRIBE
The call {INT_SUB_CONV `c1 - c2`} where {c1} and {c2} are integer literals
of type {:int}, returns {|- c1 - c2 = d} where {d} is the canonical integer
literal that is equal to {c1 - c2}. The literals {c1} and {c2} may be of the
form {&n} or {-- &n} (with nonzero {n} in the latter case) and the result will
be of the same form.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not the difference of two permitted integer
literals of type {:int}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # INT_SUB_CONV `&33 - &77`;;
  val it : thm = |- &33 - &77 = -- &44
}
