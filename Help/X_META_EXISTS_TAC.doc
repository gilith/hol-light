\DOC X_META_EXISTS_TAC

\TYPE {X_META_EXISTS_TAC : term -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Replaces existentially quantified variable with given metavariables.

\DESCRIBE
Given a variable {v} and a goal of the form {A ?- ?x. t[x]}, the tactic
{X_META_EXISTS_TAC} gives the new goal {A ?- t[v]} where {v} is a new
metavariable. In the resulting proof, it is as if the variable has been
assigned here to the later choice for this metavariable, which can be made
through {UNIFY_ACCEPT_TAC}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the metavariable is not a variable.

\EXAMPLE
See {UNIFY_ACCEPT_TAC} for an example of using metavariables.

\USES
Delaying instantiations until the correct term becomes clearer.

\COMMENTS
Users should probably steer clear of using metavariables if possible. Note that 
the metavariable instantiations apply across the whole fringe of goals, not 
just the current goal, and can lead to confusion.
