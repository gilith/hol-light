\TYPE {refine : refinement -> goalstack}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a refinement to the current goalstack.

\DESCRIBE
The call {refine r} applies the refinement {r} to the current goalstate, adding
the resulting goalstate at the head of the current goalstack list. (A goalstate
consists of a list of subgoals as well as justification and metavariable
information.)

\FAILURE
Fails if the refinement fails.

\COMMENTS
Most users will not want to handle refinements explicitly. Usually one just 
applies a tactic to the first goal in a goalstate.
