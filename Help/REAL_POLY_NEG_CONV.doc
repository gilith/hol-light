\DOC REAL_POLY_NEG_CONV

\TYPE {REAL_POLY_NEG_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Negates real polynomial while retaining canonical form.

\DESCRIBE
For many purposes it is useful to retain polynomials in a canonical form. For
more information on the usual normal form in HOL Light, see the function
{REAL_POLY_CONV}, which converts a polynomial to normal form while proving the
equivalence of the original and normalized forms. The function
{REAL_POLY_NEG_CONV} is a more delicate conversion that, given a term {--p}
where {p} is a real polynomial in normal form, returns a theorem {|- --p = p'}
where {p'} is in normal form.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not the negation of a real term. If negation 
is applied to a polynomial in non-normal form, the overall normalization is not 
guaranteed.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # REAL_POLY_NEG_CONV `--(x pow 2 + -- &1)`;;
  val it : thm = |- --(x pow 2 + -- &1) = -- &1 * x pow 2 + &1
}

\USES
More delicate polynomial operations than simply the direct normalization with 
{REAL_POLY_CONV}.
