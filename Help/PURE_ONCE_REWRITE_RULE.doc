\DOC PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_RULE : thm list -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem once with only the given list of rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
{PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_RULE} generates rewrites from the list of theorems
supplied by the user, without including the tautologies given in
{basic_rewrites}. The applicable rewrites are employed once, without
entailing in a recursive search for matches over the theorem.
See {GEN_REWRITE_RULE} for more details about rewriting strategies in
HOL.

\FAILURE
This rule does not fail, and it does not diverge.
