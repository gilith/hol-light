\DOC ONCE_REWRITE_CONV

\TYPE {ONCE_REWRITE_CONV : thm list -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a term, including built-in tautologies in the list of rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
{ONCE_REWRITE_CONV} searches for matching subterms and applies
rewrites once at each subterm, in the manner specified for
{ONCE_DEPTH_CONV}. The rewrites which are used are obtained from the
given list of theorems and the set of tautologies stored in
{basic_rewrites}. See {GEN_REWRITE_CONV} for the general method of
using theorems to rewrite a term.

\FAILURE
{ONCE_REWRITE_CONV} does not fail; it does not diverge.

\USES
{ONCE_REWRITE_CONV} can be used to rewrite a term when recursive
rewriting is not desired.
