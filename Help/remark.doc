\TYPE {remark : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Output a string and newline if and only if {verbose} flag is set.

\DESCRIBE
If the {verbose} flag is set to {true}, then the call {remark s} prints the 
string {s} and a following newline. If the {verbose} flag is set to {false},
this call does nothing. This function is used for informative output in several 
automated rules such as {MESON}.

\FAILURE

  # remark "Proof is going OK so far";;
  Proof is going OK so far
  val it : unit = ()
  # verbose := false;;
  val it : unit = ()
  #  remark "Proof is going OK so far";;
  val it : unit = ()
}
