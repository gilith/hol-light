\DOC SPEC_TAC

\TYPE {SPEC_TAC : term * term -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes a goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a pair of terms {(`u`,`x`)}, where {x} is just a variable,
and a goal {A ?- t}, the tactic {SPEC_TAC} generalizes the goal to
{A ?- !x. t[x/u]}, that is, all (free) instances of {u} are turned into {x}.
{
        A ?- t
   =================  SPEC_TAC (`u`,`x`)
    A ?- !x. t[x/u]
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless {x} is a variable with the same type as {u}.

\USES
Removing unnecessary speciality in a goal, particularly as a prelude to
an inductive proof.
