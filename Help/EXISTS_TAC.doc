\DOC EXISTS_TAC

\TYPE {EXISTS_TAC : term -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Reduces existentially quantified goal to one involving a specific witness.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, quantifier, existential, choose, witness.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {u} and a goal {A ?- ?x. t}, the tactic
{EXISTS_TAC} reduces the goal to {A ?- t[u/x]} (substituting {u}
for all free instances of {x} in {t}, with variable renaming if
necessary to avoid free variable capture).
{
    A ?- ?x. t
   =============  EXISTS_TAC `u`
    A ?- t[u/x]
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal's conclusion is existentially quantified and the
term supplied has the same type as the quantified variable in the goal.

\EXAMPLE
The goal:
{
  # g `?x. 1 < x /\ x < 3`;;
}
\noindent can be solved by:
{
  # e(EXISTS_TAC `2` THEN ARITH_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
}
