\DOC hol_expand_directory

\TYPE {hol_expand_directory : string -> string}

\SYNOPSIS
Modifies directory name starting with {$} to include HOL directory

\DESCRIBE
The function {hol_expand_directory} takes a string indicating a directory. If 
it does not begin with a dollar sign {$}, the string is returned unchanged. 
Otherwise, the initial dollar sign is replaced with the current HOL Light 
directory {hol_dir}. To get an actual {$} at the start of the returned
directory, actually use two dollar signs {$$}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # hol_dir;;
  val it : string ref = {contents = "/home/johnh/holl"}
  # hol_expand_directory "$/Help";;
  val it : string = "/home/johnh/holl/Help"
}
