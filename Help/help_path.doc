\TYPE {help_path : string list ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Path where HOL Light tries to find help files.

\DESCRIBE
The reference variable {help_path} gives a list of directories. When using the
online {help} function, HOL Light will search in these places for help files.
An initial dollar sign {$} in each path is interpreted as a reference to the
current setting of {hol_dir}. To get an actual {$} at the start of the
filename, actually use two dollar signs {$$}.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.
