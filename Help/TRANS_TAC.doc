\DOC TRANS_TAC

\TYPE {TRANS_TAC : thm -> term -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies transitivity theorem to goal with chosen intermediate term.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, modus ponens, implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a `transitivity' theorem, i.e. one of the form
{
   |- !xs. R1 x y /\ R2 y z ==> R3 x z
}
\noindent and a term {t}, {TRANS_TAC} produces a tactic that reduces a goal
with conclusion of the form {R3 s u} to one with conclusion {R1 s t /\ R2 t u}.
{
       A ?- R3 s u
  ========================  TRANS_TAC (|- !xs. R1 x y /\ R2 y z ==> R3 x z) `t`
   A ?- R1 s t /\ R2 t u
}

\EXAMPLE
Consider the simple inequality goal:
{
  # g `n < (m + 2) * (n + 1)`;;
}
We can use the following transitivity theorem
{
  # LET_TRANS;;
  val it : thm = |- !m n p. m <= n /\ n < p ==> m < p
}
{
  # e(TRANS_TAC LET_TRANS `1 * (n + 1)`);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `n <= 1 * (n + 1) /\ 1 * (n + 1) < (m + 2) * (n + 1)`
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless the input theorem is of the expected form (some of the
relations {R1}, {R2} and {R3} may be, and often are, the same) and the
conclusion matches the goal, in the usual sense of higher-order matching.

\COMMENTS
The effect of {TRANS_TAC th t} can often be replicated by the more primitive 
tactic sequence {MATCH_MP_TAC th THEN EXISTS_TAC t}. The use of {TRANS_TAC} is
not only less verbose, but it is also more general in that it ensures correct
type-instantiation of the theorem, whereas in highly polymorphic theorems the
use of {MATCH_MP_TAC} may leave the wrong types for the subsequent {EXISTS_TAC}
step.
