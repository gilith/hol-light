\TYPE {ss_of_maker : (thm -> thm list -> thm list) -> simpset -> simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Change the rewrite maker in a simpset.

\DESCRIBE
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked 
by {SIMP_TAC}) are controlled by a `simpset', which may contain conditional and 
unconditional rewrite rules, conversions and provers for conditions, as well as 
a determination of how to use the prover on the conditions and how to process 
theorems into rewrites. A call {ss_of_maker maker ss} changes the ``rewrite 
maker'' in {ss} to yield a new simpset; use of this simpset with additional 
theorems will process those theorems using the new rewrite maker. The default 
rewrite maker is {mk_rewrites} with an appropriate flag, and it is unusual to 
want to change it.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
