\DOC REAL_IDEAL_CONV

\TYPE {REAL_IDEAL_CONV : term list -> term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Produces identity proving ideal membership over the reals.

\DESCRIBE
The call {REAL_IDEAL_CONV [`p1`; ...; `pn`] `p`}, where all the terms have
type {:real} and can be considered as polynomials, will test whether {p} is in
the ideal generated by the {p1,...,pn}. If so, it will return a corresponding 
theorem {|- p = q1 * p1 + ... + qn * pn} showing how to express {p} in terms of 
the other polynomials via some `cofactors' {qi}.
                                                             
\FAILURE                    
Fails if the terms are ill-typed, or if ideal membership fails.
                   
\EXAMPLE    
In the case of a singleton list, this just corresponds to dividing one 
multivariate polynomial by another, e.g.
{
  # REAL_IDEAL_CONV [`x - &1`] `x pow 4 - &1`;; 
  1 basis elements and 0 critical pairs
  val it : thm =
    |- x pow 4 - &1 = (&1 * x pow 3 + &1 * x pow 2 + &1 * x + &1) * (x - &1)
}
