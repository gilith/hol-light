\TYPE {equals_goal : goal -> goal -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Equality test on goals.

\DESCRIBE
The relation {equals_goal} tests if two goals have exactly the same structure, 
with the same assumptions, conclusions and even labels, with the assumptions in 
the same order. The only respect in which this differs from a pure equality 
tests is that the various term components are tested modulo alpha-conversion.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
