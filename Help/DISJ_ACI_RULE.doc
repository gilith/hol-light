\DOC DISJ_ACI_RULE

\TYPE {DISJ_ACI_RULE : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equivalence of two disjunctions containing same set of disjuncts.

\DESCRIBE
The call {DISJ_ACI_RULE `t1 \/ ... \/ tn <=> u1 \/ ... \/ um`}, where both
sides of the equation are disjunctions of exactly the same set of disjuncts,
(with arbitrary ordering, association, and repetitions), will return the
corresponding theorem {|- t1 \/ ... \/ tn <=> u1 \/ ... \/ um}.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not a Boolean equation or the two sets of
disjuncts are different.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # DISJ_ACI_RULE `(p \/ q) \/ (q \/ r) <=> r \/ q \/ p`;;
  val it : thm = |- (p \/ q) \/ q \/ r <=> r \/ q \/ p
}

\COMMENTS
The same effect can be had with the more general {AC} construct. However, for
the special case of disjunction, {DISJ_ACI_RULE} is substantially more
efficient when there are many disjuncts involved.
