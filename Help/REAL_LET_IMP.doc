\DOC REAL_LET_IMP

\TYPE {REAL_LET_IMP : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Perform transitivity chaining for mixed strict/non-strict real number
inequality.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- s <= t} where {s} and {t} have type {real}, the
rule {REAL_LE_IMP} returns {A |- !x1...xn z. t < z ==> s < z}, where {z} is
some variable and the {x1,...,xn} are free variables in {s} and {t}.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a theorem whose conclusion is not of the form {`s <= t`}
for some real number terms {s} and {t}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # REAL_LET_IMP (REAL_ARITH `abs(x + y) <= abs(x) + abs(y)`);;
  val it : thm = |- !x y z. abs x + abs y < z ==> abs (x + y) < z
}

\USES
Can make transitivity chaining in goals easier, e.g. by
{FIRST_ASSUM(MATCH_MP_TAC o REAL_LE_IMP)}.
