\TYPE {undefined : ('a, 'b) func}

\SYNOPSIS
Completely undefined finite partial function.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of a suite of operations on finite partial functions, type 
{('a,'b)func}. These may sometimes be preferable to ordinary functions since
they permit more operations such as equality comparison, extraction of domain
etc. The value {undefined} is the `empty' finite partial function that is
nowhere defined.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # (undefined:(string,term)func);;
  val it : (string, term) func = <func>
  # apply it "anything";;
  Exception: Failure "apply".
}

\USES
Starting a function to be augmented pointwise.
