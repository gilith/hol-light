\DOC EQ_IMP_RULE

\TYPE {EQ_IMP_RULE : thm -> thm * thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Derives forward and backward implication from equality of boolean terms.

\KEYWORDS
rule, implication, equality.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- t1 <=> t2}, where {t1} and {t2} both have
type {bool}, the inference rule {EQ_IMP_RULE} returns the
theorems {A |- t1 ==> t2} and {A |- t2 ==> t1}.
{
              A |- t1 <=> t2
   -----------------------------------  EQ_IMP_RULE
    A |- t1 ==> t2     A |- t2 ==> t1
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless the conclusion of the given theorem is an equation between
boolean terms.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # SPEC_ALL CONJ_SYM;;
  val it : thm = |- t1 /\ t2 <=> t2 /\ t1

  # EQ_IMP_RULE it;;
  val it : thm * thm = (|- t1 /\ t2 ==> t2 /\ t1, |- t2 /\ t1 ==> t1 /\ t2)
}
