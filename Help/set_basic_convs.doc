\DOC set_basic_convs

\TYPE {set_basic_convs : (string * (term * conv)) list -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Assign the set of default conversions.

\DESCRIBE
The HOL Light rewriter ({REWRITE_TAC} etc.) and simplifier ({SIMP_TAC} etc.) 
have default sets of (conditional) equations and other conversions that are 
applied by default, except in the {PURE_} variants. The latter are normally
term transformations that cannot be expressed as single (conditional or
unconditional) rewrite rules. A call to {set_basic_convs l} where {l} is a list
of items ("name",(`pat`,conv)) will make the default conversions just that set,
using the name {name} to refer to each one and restricting it to subterms
encountered that match {pat}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
Normally, users will only want to extend the existing set of conversions using 
{extend_basic_convs}.
