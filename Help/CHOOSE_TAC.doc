\TYPE {CHOOSE_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Adds the body of an existentially quantified theorem to the assumptions of
a goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, existential.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A' |- ?x. t} and a goal, {CHOOSE_TAC} adds
{t[x'/x]} to the assumptions of the goal, where {x'} is a variant of {x}
which is not free in the assumption list; normally {x'} is just {x}.
{
         A ?- u
   ====================  CHOOSE_TAC (A' |- ?x. t)
    A u {{t[x'/x]}} ?- u
}
\noindent Unless {A'} is a subset of {A}, this is not a valid tactic.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the given theorem is existentially quantified.

\EXAMPLE
Suppose we have a goal asserting that the output of an electrical circuit
(represented as a boolean-valued function) will become high at some time:
{
   ?- ?t. output(t)
}
\noindent and we have the following theorems available:
{
   t1 = |- ?t. input(t)
   t2 = !t. input(t) ==> output(t+1)
}
\noindent Then the goal can be solved by the application of:
{
   CHOOSE_TAC t1 THEN EXISTS_TAC `t+1` THEN
   UNDISCH_TAC `input (t:num) :bool` THEN MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC t2
}
