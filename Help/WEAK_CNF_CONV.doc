\DOC WEAK_CNF_CONV

\TYPE {WEAK_CNF_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a term already in negation normal form into conjunctive normal form.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term already in negation normal form (see {NNF_CONV}), 
meaning that all other propositional connectives have been eliminated in favour 
of conjunction, disjunction and negation, and negation is only applied to 
atomic formulas, {WEAK_CNF_CONV} puts the term into an equivalent conjunctive
normal form, which is a conjunction of disjunctions.

\FAILURE
Never fails; non-Boolean terms will just yield a reflexive theorem.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # WEAK_CNF_CONV `(a /\ b) \/ (a /\ b /\ c) \/ d`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- a /\ b \/ a /\ b /\ c \/ d <=>
       ((a \/ a \/ d) /\ (b \/ a \/ d)) /\
       ((a \/ b \/ d) /\ (b \/ b \/ d)) /\
       (a \/ c \/ d) /\
       (b \/ c \/ d)
}

\COMMENTS
The ordering and associativity of the resulting form are not guaranteed, and it
may contain duplicates. See {CNF_CONV} for a stronger (but somewhat slower)
variant where this is important.
