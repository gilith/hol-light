\TYPE {p : unit -> goalstack}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints the top level of the subgoal package goal stack.

\DESCRIBE
The function {p} is part of the subgoal package, and prints the current
goalstate.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
Examining the proof state during an interactive proof session.

\COMMENTS
Strictly speaking this function is side-effect-free. It simply {{\em returns}}
the current goalstate. However, automatic printing will normally then print it,
so that is the net effect.
