\TYPE {MK_COMB_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks down a goal between function applications into equality of functions and 
arguments.

\DESCRIBE
Given a goal whose conclusion is an equation between function applications 
{A ?- f x = g y}, the tactic {MK_COMB_TAC} breaks it down to two subgoals 
expressing equality of the corresponding rators and rands:
{
            A ?- f x = g y
   ================================  MK_COMB_TAC
      A ?- f = g      A ?- x = y
}

\FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the goal is not an equation between applications.
