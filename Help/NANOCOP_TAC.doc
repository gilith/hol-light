\TYPE {NANOCOP_TAC : thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Automated first-order proof search tactic using nanoCoP algorithm.

\DESCRIBE
A call to {NANOCOP_TAC[theorems]} will attempt to establish the current goal
using pure first-order reasoning, taking {theorems} as the starting-point.
It will usually either solve the goal completely or run for an infeasibly long
time, but it may sometimes fail quickly. This tactic is analogous to
{MESON_TAC}, and many of the same general comments apply.

\FAILURE
Fails if the goal is unprovable within the search bounds.

\EXAMPLE
Here is a simple fact about natural number sums as a goal:
{
  # g `!f u v.
         FINITE u /\ (!x. x IN v /\ ~(x IN u) ==> f x = 0)
         ==> nsum (u UNION v) f = nsum u f`;;

}
It is solved in a fraction of a second by {NANOCOP_TAC} with some relevant
lemmas:
{
  # e(NANOCOP_TAC[SUBSET; NSUM_SUPERSET; IN_UNION]);;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
}
