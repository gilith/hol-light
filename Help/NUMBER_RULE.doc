\DOC NUMBER_RULE

\TYPE {NUMBER_RULE : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Automatically prove elementary divisibility property over the natural numbers.

\DESCRIBE
{NUMBER_RULE} is a partly heuristic rule that can often automatically prove
elementary ``divisibility'' properties of the natural numbers. The precise
subset that is dealt with is difficult to describe rigorously, but many
universally quantified combinations of {divides}, {coprime}, {gcd} and
congruences {(x == y) (mod n)} can be proved automatically, as well as some
existentially quantified goals. See a similar rule {INTEGER_RULE} for the 
integers for a representative set of examples.

\FAILURE
Fails if the goal is not accessible to the methods used.

\EXAMPLE
Here is a typical example, which would be rather tedious to prove manually:
{
  # NUMBER_RULE
     `!a b a' b'. ~(gcd(a,b) = 0) /\ a = a' * gcd(a,b) /\ b = b' * gcd(a,b)    
                  ==> coprime(a',b')`;;
  ... 
  val it : thm =
  |- !a b a' b'.
        ~(gcd (a,b) = 0) /\ a = a' * gcd (a,b) /\ b = b' * gcd (a,b)
        ==> coprime (a',b')
}
