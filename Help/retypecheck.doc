\TYPE {retypecheck : (string * pretype) list -> preterm -> preterm}

\SYNOPSIS
Typecheck a term, iterating over possible overload resolutions.

\DESCRIBE
This is the main HOL Light typechecking function. Given an environment {env} of 
pretype assignments for variables, it assigns a pretype to all variables and 
constants, including performing resolution of overloaded constants based on 
what type information there is. Normally, this happens implicitly when a term 
is entered in the quotation parser.

\FAILURE
Fails if some terms cannot be consistently assigned a type.

\COMMENTS
Only users seeking to change HOL's parser and typechecker quite radically need 
to use this function.
