\TYPE {the_type_definitions : ((string * string * string) * (thm * thm)) list ref}

\SYNOPSIS
List of type definitions made so far.

\DESCRIBE
The reference variable {the_type_definitions} holds a list of entries, one for 
each type definition made so far with {new_type_definition}. It is not normally 
explicitly manipulated by the user, but is automatically augmented by each call
of {new_type_definition}. Each entry contains three strings (the type name,
type constructor name and destructor name) and two theorems (the input
nonemptiness theorem and the returned type bijections). That is, for a call:
{
  bijth = new_type_definition tyname (absname,repname) nonempth;;
}
\noindent the entry created in this list is:
{
 (tyname,absname,repname),(nonempth,bijth)
}
Note that the entries made using other interfaces to 
{new_basic_type_definition}, such as {define_type}, are not included in this 
list.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\USES
This is mainly intended for internal use in {new_type_definition}, so that 
repeated instances of the same definition are ignored rather than rejected. 
Some users may find the information useful too.

\SEEALSO
