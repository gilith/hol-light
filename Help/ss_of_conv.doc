\DOC ss_of_conv

\TYPE {ss_of_conv : term -> conv -> simpset -> simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Add a new conversion to a simpset.

\DESCRIBE
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked 
by {SIMP_TAC}) are controlled by a `simpset', which may contain conditional and 
unconditional rewrite rules, conversions and provers for conditions, as well as 
a determination of how to use the prover on the conditions and how to process 
theorems into rewrites. A call {ss_of_conv pat cnv ss} adds the conversion 
{cnv} to the simpset {ss} to yield a new simpset, restricting the initial 
filtering of potential subterms to those matching {pat}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # ss_of_conv `x + y:num` NUM_ADD_CONV empty_ss;;
  ...
}
