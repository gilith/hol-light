\DOC EXISTS_EQUATION

\TYPE {EXISTS_EQUATION : term -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Derives existence from explicit equational constraint.

\DESCRIBE
Given a term {`x = t`} where {x} does not occur free in {t}, and a 
theorem {A |- p[x]}, the rule {EXISTS_EQUATION} returns
{A - {{x = t}} |- ?x. p[x]}. Normally, the equation {x = t} is one of the 
hypotheses of the theorem, so this rule allows one to derive an existence 
assertion ignoring the actual ``definition''.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not an equation, if the LHS is not a variable, or if the 
variable occurs free in the RHS.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # let th = (UNDISCH o EQT_ELIM o SIMP_CONV[ARITH]) 
     `x = 3 ==> ODD(x) /\ x > 2`;;
  val th : thm = x = 3 |- ODD x /\ x > 2

  # EXISTS_EQUATION `x = 3` th;;
  val it : thm = |- ?x. ODD x /\ x > 2
}
\noindent Note that it is not obligatory for the term to be an assumption:
{
  # EXISTS_EQUATION `x = 1` (REFL `x:num`);;
  val it : thm = |- ?x. x = x
}
