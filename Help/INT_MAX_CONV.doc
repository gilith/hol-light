\DOC INT_MAX_CONV

\TYPE {INT_MAX_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Conversion to perform addition on two integer literals of type {:int}.

\DESCRIBE
The call {INT_MAX_CONV `max c1 c2`} where {c1} and {c2} are integer literals
of type {:int}, returns {|- max c1 c2 = d} where {d} is the canonical integer
literal that is equal to {max c1 c2}. The literals {c1} and {c2} may be of the
form {&n} or {-- &n} (with nonzero {n} in the latter case) and the result will
be of the same form.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not the maximum operator applied to two
permitted integer literals of type {:int}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # INT_MAX_CONV `max (-- &1) (&2)`;;
  val it : thm = |- max (-- &1) (&2) = &2
}
