\DOC term_unify

\TYPE {term_unify : term list -> term -> term -> instantiation}

\SYNOPSIS
Unify two terms.

\DESCRIBE
Given two terms {tm1} and {tm2}, a call {term_unify vars tm1 tm2} attempts to 
find instantiations of the variables {vars} in the two terms to make them 
alpha-equivalent. At present, no type instantiation is done. The unification is 
also purely first-order. In these respects it is less general than 
{term_match}, and this may be improved in the future.

\FAILURE
Fails if the two terms are not first-order unifiable by instantiating the given 
variables without type instantiation.

\SEEALSO
instantiate, term_match.
