\DOC CONDS_CELIM_CONV

\TYPE {CONDS_CELIM_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Remove all conditional expressions from a Boolean formula.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a Boolean term, {CONDS_CELIM_CONV} identifies subterms that are
conditional expressions of the form `{if p then x else y}', and eliminates
them. First they are ``pulled out'' as far as possible, e.g.
from `{f (if p then x else y)}' to `{if p then f(x) else f(y)}' and so on. When
a quantifier that binds one of the variables in the expression is reached, the
subterm is of Boolean type, say `{if p then q else r}', and it is replaced by a
propositional equivalent of the form `{(~p \/ q) /\ (p \/ r)}'.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but will just return a reflexive theorem if the term is not
Boolean.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # CONDS_CELIM_CONV `y <= z ==> !x. (if x <= y then y else x) <= z`;;     
  val it : thm =
    |- y <= z ==> (!x. (if x <= y then y else x) <= z) <=>
       y <= z ==> (!x. (~(x <= y) \/ y <= z) /\ (x <= y \/ x <= z))
}

\USES
Mostly for initial normalization in automated rules, but may be helpful for
other uses.

\COMMENTS
The function {CONDS_ELIM_CONV} is functionally similar, but will do the final
propositional splitting in a ``disjunctive'' rather than ``conjunctive'' way.
The disjunctive way is usually better when the term will subsequently be passed
to a refutation procedure, whereas the conjunctive form is better for
non-refutation procedures. In each case, the policy is changed in an 
appropriate way after passing through quantifiers.
