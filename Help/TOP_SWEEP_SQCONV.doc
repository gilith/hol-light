\DOC TOP_SWEEP_SQCONV

\TYPE {TOP_SWEEP_SQCONV : strategy}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies simplification top-down at all levels, but after descending to
subterms, does not return to higher ones.

\DESCRIBE
HOL Light's simplification functions (e.g. {SIMP_TAC}) have their traversal
algorithm controlled by a ``strategy''. {TOP_SWEEP_SQCONV} is a strategy
corresponding to {TOP_SWEEP_CONV} for ordinary conversions: simplification is
applied top-down at all levels, but after descending to subterms, does not
return to higher ones.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.
