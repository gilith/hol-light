\DOC CONJ_ACI_RULE

\TYPE {CONJ_ACI_RULE : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equivalence of two conjunctions containing same set of conjuncts.

\DESCRIBE
The call {CONJ_ACI_RULE `t1 /\ ... /\ tn <=> u1 /\ ... /\ um`}, where both
sides of the equation are conjunctions of exactly the same set of conjuncts,
(with arbitrary ordering, association, and repetitions), will return the
corresponding theorem {|- t1 /\ ... /\ tn <=> u1 /\ ... /\ um}.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not a Boolean equation or the two sets of 
conjuncts are different.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # CONJ_ACI_RULE `(a /\ b) /\ (a /\ c) <=> (a /\ (c /\ a)) /\ b`;;
  val it : thm = |- (a /\ b) /\ a /\ c <=> (a /\ c /\ a) /\ b
}

\COMMENTS
The same effect can be had with the more general {AC} construct. However, for 
the special case of conjunction, {CONJ_ACI_RULE} is substantially more 
efficient when there are many conjuncts involved.
