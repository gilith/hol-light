\DOC CHEAT_TAC

\TYPE {CHEAT_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves goal by asserting it as an axiom.

\DESCRIBE
Given any goal {A ?- p}, the tactic {CHEAT_TAC} solves it by using {mk_thm}, 
which in turn involves essentially asserting the goal as a new axiom.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
Temporarily plugging boring parts of a proof to deal with the interesting 
parts.

\COMMENTS
Needless to say, this should be used with caution since once new axioms are 
asserted there is no guarantee that logical consistency is preserved.
