This reference variable holds the directory (folder) for the base of the HOL

built, but picked up from the system variable {HOLLIGHT_DIR} if it is defined.

\FAILURE

\EXAMPLE
On my laptop, the value is:
{
  # !hol_dir;;
  val it : string = "/home/johnh/holl"
}

\USES
Ensuring that HOL Light can find any libraries or other system files needed to
support proofs.
