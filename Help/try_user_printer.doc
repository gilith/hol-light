\TYPE {try_user_printer : term -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Try user-defined printers on a term.

\DESCRIBE
HOL Light allows arbitrary user printers to be inserted into the toplevel
printer so that they are invoked on all applicable subterms (see
{install_user_printer}). The call {try_user_printer tm} attempts all installed 
user printers on the term {tm} in an implementation-defined order. If one 
succeeds, the call returns {()}, and otherwise it fails.

\FAILURE
Fails if no user printer is applicable to the given term (e.g. if no user 
printers have been installed).

\EXAMPLE
After installing the printer for variables with types in the example for 
{install_user_printer}, you can try:
{
  # try_user_printer `x:num`;;
  (x:num)val it : unit = ()
  
  # try_user_printer `1`;;
  Exception: Failure "tryfind".
}
