\TYPE {definitions : unit -> thm list}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the current set of primitive definitions.

\DESCRIBE
A call {definitions()} returns the current list of basic definitions made in 
the HOL Light kernel.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
This is a more logically primitive list than the one maintained in the list
{!the_definitions}, and is intended mainly for auditing a proof development 
that uses axioms to ensure that no axioms and definitions clash. Under normal
circumstances axioms are not used and so this information is not needed.
Definitions returned by {definitions()} are in their primitive equational form,
and include everything defined in the kernel. By contrast, those in the list
{!the_definitions} are often quantified and eta-expanded, and the list may be
incomplete since it is only maintained outside the logical kernel as a 
convenience.
