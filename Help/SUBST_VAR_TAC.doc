\DOC SUBST_VAR_TAC

\TYPE {SUBST_VAR_TAC : thm -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Use an equation to substitute ``safely'' in goal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem with an equational hypothesis {A |- s = t}, {SUBST_ 
VAR_TAC} has no effect if {s} and {t} are alpha-equivalent. Otherwise, if 
either side of the equation is a variable not free in the other side, or a 
constant, and the conclusion contains no free variables not free in some 
assumption of the goal, then the theorem is used to replace that constant or 
variable throughout the goal, assumptions and conclusions. If none of these 
cases apply, or the conclusion is not even an equation, the application fails.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a non-equation for which none of the cases above hold.

\USES
By some sequence like {REPEAT(FIRST_X_ASSUM SUBST_VAR_TAC)} one can use all 
possible assumptions to substitute ``safely'', in the sense that it will not 
change the provability status of the goal. This is sometimes a useful prelude 
to other automatic techniques.
