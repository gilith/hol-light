\DOC compose_insts

\TYPE {compose_insts : instantiation -> instantiation -> instantiation}

\SYNOPSIS
Compose two instantiations.

\DESCRIBE
Given two instantiations {i1} and {i2} (with type {instantiation}, as returned
by {term_match} for example), the call {compose_insts i1 i2} will give a new
instantiation that results from composing them, with {i1} applied first and 
then {i2}. For example, {instantiate (compose_insts i1 i2) t} should be the
same as {instantiate i2 (instantiate i1 t)}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
Mostly of specialized interest; used in sequencing tactics like {THEN} to 
compose metavariable instantiations.
