\DOC is_eq

\TYPE {is_eq : term -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests a term to see if it is an equation.

\DESCRIBE
{is_eq `t1 = t2`} returns {true}. If the term is not an equation the result
is {false}. Note that logical equivalence is just equality on type {:bool},
even though it is printed as {<=>}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # is_eq `2 + 2 = 4`;;
  val it : bool = true

  # is_eq `p /\ q <=> q /\ p`;;
  val it : bool = true

  #  is_eq `p ==> p`;;
  val it : bool = false
}
