\TYPE {GSYM : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Reverses the first equation(s) encountered in a top-down search.

\KEYWORDS
rule, symmetry, equality.

\DESCRIBE
The inference rule {GSYM} reverses the first equation(s) encountered in a
top-down search of the conclusion of the argument theorem. An equation will be
reversed iff it is not a proper subterm of another equation. If a theorem
contains no equations, it will be returned unchanged.

\FAILURE
Never fails, and never loops infinitely.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # ADD;;
  val it : thm = |- (!n. 0 + n = n) /\ (!m n. SUC m + n = SUC (m + n))

  # GSYM ADD;;
  val it : thm = |- (!n. n = 0 + n) /\ (!m n. SUC (m + n) = SUC m + n)
}
