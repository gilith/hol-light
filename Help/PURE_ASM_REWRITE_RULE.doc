\DOC PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE : thm list -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem including the theorem's assumptions as rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
The list of theorems supplied by the user and the assumptions of the
object theorem are used to generate a set of rewrites, without adding
implicitly the basic tautologies stored under {basic_rewrites}.
The rule searches for matching subterms in a top-down recursive
fashion, stopping only when no more rewrites apply. For a general
description of rewriting strategies see {GEN_REWRITE_RULE}.

\FAILURE
Rewriting with {PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} does not result in failure. It
may diverge, in which case {PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} may be used.
