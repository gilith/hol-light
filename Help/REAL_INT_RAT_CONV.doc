\DOC REAL_INT_RAT_CONV

\TYPE {REAL_INT_RAT_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Convert basic rational constant of real type to canonical form.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term that is a rational constant of type {:real},
{REAL_INT_RAT_CONV} converts it to an explicit ratio {&p / &q} or {-- &p / &q}; 
{q} is always there, even if it is {1}.

\FAILURE
Never fails; simply has no effect if it is not applied to a suitable constant.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # REAL_INT_RAT_CONV `&22 / &7`;;
  val it : thm = |- &22 / &7 = &22 / &7

  # REAL_INT_RAT_CONV `&42`;;
  val it : thm = |- &42 = &42 / &1

  # REAL_INT_RAT_CONV `#3.1415926`;;
  val it : thm = |- #3.1415926 = &31415926 / &10000000
}

\USES
Mainly for internal use as a preprocessing step in rational-number 
calculations.
