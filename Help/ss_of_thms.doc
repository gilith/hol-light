\DOC ss_of_thms

\TYPE {ss_of_thms : thm list -> simpset -> simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Add theorems to a simpset.

\DESCRIBE
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked 
by {SIMP_TAC}) are controlled by a `simpset', which may contain conditional and 
unconditional rewrite rules, conversions and provers for conditions, as well as 
a determination of how to use the prover on the conditions and how to process 
theorems into rewrites. A call {ss_of_thms thl ss} processes the theorems {thl}
according to the rewrite maker in the simpset {ss} (normally {mk_rewrites}) and
adds them to the theorems in {ss} to yield a new simpset.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # ss_of_thms [ADD_CLAUSES] empty_ss;;
  ...
}
