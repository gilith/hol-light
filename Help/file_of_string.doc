\DOC file_of_string

\TYPE {file_of_string : string -> string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Write out a string to a named file.

\DESCRIBE
Given a filename {fn} and a string {s}, the call {file_of_string fn s} attempts
to open the file {fn} for writing and writes the string {s} to it before
closing. If the file exists, it will be overwritten, and otherwise a new file
will be created.

\FAILURE
Fails if the file cannot be opened for writing.

\EXAMPLE
The call
{
  # file_of_string "/tmp/hello" "Hello world\nGoodbye world";;
  val it : unit = ()
}
will result in a file {/tmp/hello} containing the text:
{
Hello world
Goodbye world
