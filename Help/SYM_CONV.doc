\DOC SYM_CONV

\TYPE {SYM_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Interchanges the left and right-hand sides of an equation.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, symmetry, equality.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to an equational term {t1 = t2}, the conversion
{SYM_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- t1 = t2 <=> t2 = t1
}

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not an equation.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # SYM_CONV `2 = x`;; 
  val it : thm = |- 2 = x <=> x = 2
}
