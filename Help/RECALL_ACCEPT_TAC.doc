\DOC RECALL_ACCEPT_TAC

\TYPE {RECALL_ACCEPT_TAC : ('a -> thm) -> 'a -> goal -> goalstate}

\SYNOPSIS
Delay evaluation of theorem-producing function till needed.

\DESCRIBE
Given a theorem-producing inference rule {f} and its argument {a}, the tactic 
{RECALL_ACCEPT_TAC f a} will evaluate {th = f a} and do {ACCEPT_TAC th}, but 
only when the tactic is applied to a goal.

\FAILURE
Never fails until subsequently applied to a goal, but then may fail if the
theorem-producing function does.

\EXAMPLE
You might for example do
{
  RECALL_ACCEPT_TAC (EQT_ELIM o NUM_REDUCE_CONV) `16 EXP 53 < 15 EXP 55`;;
}
\noindent and the call 
{
  (EQT_ELIM o NUM_REDUCE_CONV) `16 EXP 53 < 15 EXP 55`
}
\noindent will be delayed until the tactic is applied.

\USES
Delaying a time-consuming compound inference rule in a tactic script until it 
is actually used.
