\TYPE {prioritize_real : unit -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Give real number type {real} priority in operator overloading.

\DESCRIBE
Symbols for several arithmetical (`{+}', `{-}', ...) and relational (`{<}',
`{>=}', ...) operators are overloaded so that they may denote the operators
for several different number systems, particularly {num} (natural numbers),
{int} (integers) and {real} (real numbers). The choice is normally made based
on some known types, or the presence of operators that are not overloaded for
the number systems. (For example, numerals like {42} are always assumed to be
of type {num}, while the division operator `{/}' is only defined for {real}.)
In the absence of any such indication, a default choice will be made. The
effect of {prioritize_real()} is to make {real}, the real number type, the
default.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
With real priority, most things are interpreted as type {real}:
{
  # prioritize_real();;
  val it : unit = ()

  # type_of `x + y`;;
  val it : hol_type = `:real`
}
\noindent except that numerals are always of type {num}, and so:
{
  # type_of `x + 1`;;
  val it : hol_type = `:num`
}
\noindent and any explicit type information is used before using the defaults:
{
  # type_of `(x:int) + y`;;
  val it : hol_type = `:int`
}

\COMMENTS
It is perhaps better practice to insert types explicitly to avoid dependence on
such defaults, otherwise proofs can become context-dependent. However it is
often very convenient.
