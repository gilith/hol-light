\DOC mk_thm

\TYPE {mk_thm : term list * term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Creates an arbitrary theorem as an axiom (dangerous!)

\DESCRIBE
The function {mk_thm} can be used to construct an arbitrary theorem. It is
applied to a pair consisting of the desired assumption list (possibly empty)
and conclusion. All the terms therein should be of type {bool}.
{
   mk_thm([`a1`;...;`an`],`c`) = ({{a1,...,an}} |- c)
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless all the terms provided for assumptions and conclusion are of type
{bool}.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows how to create a simple contradiction:
{
   #mk_thm([],`F`);;
   |- F
}

\COMMENTS
Although {mk_thm} can be useful for experimentation or temporarily plugging
gaps, its use should be avoided if at all possible in important proofs, because
it can be used to create theorems leading to contradictions. You can check
whether any axioms have been asserted by {mk_thm} or {new_axiom} by the call
{axioms()}.
