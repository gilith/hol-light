\DOC unhide_constant

\TYPE {unhide_constant : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Restores recognition of a constant by the quotation parser.

\DESCRIBE
A call {unhide_constant "c"}, where {c} is a hidden constant, will unhide the
constant, that is, will make the quotation parser recognize it as such rather
than parsing it as a variable. It reverses the effect of the call
{hide_constant name}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the given name is a hidden constant in the current theory.

\COMMENTS
The hiding of a constant only affects the quotation parser; the constant is
still there in a theory, and may not be redefined.

\SEEALSO
hide_constant, is_hidden.
