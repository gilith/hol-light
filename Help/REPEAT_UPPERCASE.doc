\TYPE {REPEAT : tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Repeatedly applies a tactic until it fails.

\KEYWORDS
tactical.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic {REPEAT t} is a tactic which applies {t} to a goal, and while it
succeeds, continues applying it to all subgoals generated.

\FAILURE
The application of {REPEAT} to a tactic never fails, and neither does the
composite tactic, even if the basic tactic fails immediately, unless it raises 
an exception other that {Failure ...}.

\EXAMPLE
If we start with a goal having many universal quantifiers:
{
  # g `!w x y z. w < z /\ x < y ==> w * x + 1 <= y * z`;;
}
\noindent then {GEN_TAC} will strip them off one at a time:
{
  # e GEN_TAC;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)
  
  `!x y z. w < z /\ x < y ==> w * x + 1 <= y * z`
}
\noindent and {REPEAT GEN_TAC} will strip them off as far as possible:
{
  # e(REPEAT GEN_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `w < z /\ x < y ==> w * x + 1 <= y * z`
}
Similarly, {REPEAT COND_CASES_TAC} will eliminate all free conditionals in the 
goal instead of just one.
