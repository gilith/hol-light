\DOC strip_gabs

\TYPE {strip_gabs : term -> term list * term}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks apart an iterated generalized or basic abstraction.

\DESCRIBE
If the term {t} is iteratively constructed by basic or generalized 
abstractions, i.e. is of the form {\vs1. \vs2. ... \vsn. t}, then the call
{strip_gabs t} returns a pair of the list of varstructs and the term
{[vs1; vs2; ...; vsn],t}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, though the list of varstructs will be empty if the initial term is
no sort of abstraction.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # strip_gabs `\(a,b) c ((d,e),f). (a - b) + c + (d - e) * f`;;
  val it : term list * term =
    ([`a,b`; `c`; `(d,e),f`], `a - b + c + (d - e) * f`)
}
