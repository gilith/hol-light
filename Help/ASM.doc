\TYPE {ASM : (thm list -> tactic) -> thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Augments a tactic's theorem list with the assumptions.

\DESCRIBE
If {tac} is a tactic that expects a list of theorems as its arguments, e.g.
{MESON_TAC}, {REWRITE_TAC} or {SET_TAC}, then {ASM tac} converts it to a tactic
where that list is augmented by the goal's assumptions.

\FAILURE
Never fails (though the resulting tactic may do).

\EXAMPLE
{
The inbuilt {ASM_REWRITE_TAC} is in fact defined as just {ASM REWRITE_TAC}.
}

\SEEALSO
ASSUM_LIST, FREEZE_THEN, HYP, MESON_TAC, REWRITE_TAC, SET_TAC.
