\DOC dest_char

\TYPE {dest_char : term -> char}

\SYNOPSIS
Produces OCaml character corresponding to object-level character.

\DESCRIBE
{dest_char t} where {t} is a term of HOL type {char}, produces the 
corresponding OCaml character.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not of type {char}

\EXAMPLE
{
  # lhand `"hello"`;;
  val it : term = `ASCII F T T F T F F F`

  # dest_char it;;
  val it : char = 'h'
}

\COMMENTS
There is no particularly convenient parser/printer support for the HOL {char} 
type, but when combined into lists they are considered as strings and provided 
with more intuitive parser/printer support.
