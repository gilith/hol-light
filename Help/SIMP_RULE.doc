\DOC SIMP_RULE

\TYPE {SIMP_RULE : thm list -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplify conclusion of a theorem repeatedly by conditional contextual
rewriting.

\DESCRIBE
A call {SIMP_CONV thl (|- tm)} will return {|- tm'} where {tm'} results from
applying the theorems in {thl} as (conditional) rewrite rules, as well as
built-in simplifications (see {basic_rewrites} and {basic_convs}). For more
details on this kind of conditional rewriting, see {SIMP_CONV}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but may return the input theorem unchanged if no simplifications
were applicable.
