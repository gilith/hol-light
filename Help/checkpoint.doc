\DOC checkpoint

\TYPE {checkpoint : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Exits HOL Light but saves current state ready to restart.

\DESCRIBE
This is only available in Linux. A call {checkpoint s} calls the {freeze}
function from CryoPID to create a checkpoint of the current state of HOL Light,
named {hol.snapshot}. When this image is restarted, the string {s} is printed
as well as the usual startup banner.

\FAILURE
Never fails, except in the face of OS-level problems such as running out of
disc space.

\USES
To quickly save the state of HOL Light when it would take a long time to
regenerate.

\COMMENTS
Unfortunately I do not know of any checkpointing tool that can give this
behaviour under Windows or Mac OS X. See the README file and tutorial for
additional information on Linux checkpointing options.
