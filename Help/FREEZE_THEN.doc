\TYPE {FREEZE_THEN : thm_tactical}

\SYNOPSIS
`Freezes' a theorem to prevent instantiation of its free variables.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, selective, free.

\DESCRIBE
{FREEZE_THEN} expects a tactic-generating function {f:thm->tactic}
and a theorem {(A1 |- w)} as arguments.  The tactic-generating function {f}
is applied to the theorem {(w |- w)}.  If this tactic generates the subgoal:
{
    A ?- t
   =========  f (w |- w)
    A ?- t1
}
\noindent then applying {FREEZE_THEN f (A1 |- w)}
to the goal {(A ?- t)} produces the subgoal:
{
    A ?- t
   =========  FREEZE_THEN f (A1 |- w)
    A ?- t1
}
\noindent Since the term {w} is a hypothesis of the argument to the
function {f}, none of the free variables present in {w} may be
instantiated or generalized.  The hypothesis is discharged by
{PROVE_HYP} upon the completion of the proof of the subgoal.

\FAILURE
Failures may arise from the tactic-generating function.  An invalid
tactic arises if the hypotheses of the theorem are not
alpha-convertible to assumptions of the goal.

\USES
Used in serious proof hacking to limit the matches achievable by rewriting etc.
