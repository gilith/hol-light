\DOC startup_banner

\TYPE {startup_banner : string}

\SYNOPSIS
The one-line startup banner for HOL Light.

\DESCRIBE
This string is the startup banner for HOL Light, and is displayed when
standalone images (see {self_destruct}) are started up. It  is only available
in HOL images created using checkpointing (as in the default Linux build
arising from {make all}), not when the HOL Light sources have simply been
loaded into the OCaml toplevel without checkpointing.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\EXAMPLE
On my home computer, the value is currently:
{
  # startup_banner;;
  val it : string =
    "        HOL Light 2.10, built 16 March 2006 on OCaml 3.08.3"
}

\SEEALSO
self_destruct.
