\DOC subset

\TYPE {subset : 'a list -> 'a list -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests if one list is a subset of another.

\DESCRIBE
The call {subset l1 l2} returns {true} if every element of {l1} also occurs in 
{l2}, regardless of whether an element appears once or more than once in each 
list. So when {l1} and {l2} are regarded as sets, this is a subset test.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # subset [1;1;2;2] [1;2;3];;
  val it : bool = true
}

\SEEALSO
insert, intersect, set_eq, setify, subtract, union.
