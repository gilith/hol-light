\TYPE {mergesort : ('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list}

\SYNOPSIS
Sorts the list with respect to given ordering using mergesort algorithm.

\DESCRIBE
If {ord} is a total order, a call {mergesort ord l} will sort the list {l} 
according to the order {ord}. It works internally by a mergesort algorithm. 
From a user's point of view, this just means: (i) its worst-case performance is 
much better than {sort}, which uses quicksort, but (ii) it will not reliably 
topologically sort for a non-total order, whereas {sort} will.

\FAILURE
Never fails unless the ordering function fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # mergesort (<) [6;2;5;9;2;5;3];;
  val it : int list = [2; 2; 3; 5; 5; 6; 9]
}
