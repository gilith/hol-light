\TYPE {is_binary : string -> term -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests if a term is an application of a named binary operator.

\DESCRIBE
The call {is_binary s tm} tests if term {tm} is an instance of a binary
operator {(op l) r} where {op} is a constant with name {s}. If so, it returns
true; otherwise it returns false. Note that {op} is required to be a constant.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
This one succeeds:
{
  # is_binary "+" `1 + 2`;;
  val it : bool = true
}
\noindent but this one fails unless {f} has been declared a constant:
{
  # is_binary "f" `f x y`;;
  Warning: inventing type variables
  val it : bool = false
}
