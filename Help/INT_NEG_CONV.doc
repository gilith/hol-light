\DOC INT_NEG_CONV

\TYPE {INT_NEG_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Conversion to negate an integer literal of type {:int}.

\DESCRIBE
The call {INT_NEG_CONV `--c`}, where {c} is an integer literal of type
{:int}, returns the theorem {|- --c = d} where {d} is the canonical integer
literal that is equal to {c}'s negation. The literal {c} may be of the form
{&n} or {-- &n} (with nonzero {n} in the latter case) and the result will be of
the same form.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not the negation of one of the permitted
forms of integer literal of type {:int}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # INT_NEG_CONV `-- (-- &3 / &2)`;;
  val it : thm = |- --(-- &3 / &2) = &3 / &2
}

\COMMENTS
The related function {REAL_RAT_NEG_CONV} subsumes this functionality, also
applying to rational literals. Unless the restriction to integers is desired or
a tiny efficiency difference matters, it should be used in preference.
