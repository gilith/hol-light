\TYPE {basic_prover : (simpset -> 'a -> term -> thm) -> simpset -> 'a -> term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
The basic prover use function used in the simplifier.

\DESCRIBE
The HOL Light simplifier (e.g. as invoked by {SIMP_TAC}) allows provers of type
{prover} to be installed into simpsets, to automatically dispose of
side-conditions. There is another component of the simpset that controls how 
these are applied to unproven subgoals arising in simplification. The 
{basic_prover} function, which is used in all the standard simpsets, simply 
tries to simplify the goals with the rewrites as far as possible, then tries 
the provers one at a time on the resulting subgoals till one succeeds.

\FAILURE
Never fails, though the later application to a term may fail to prove it.
