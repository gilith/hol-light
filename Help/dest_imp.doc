\DOC dest_imp

\TYPE {dest_imp : term -> term * term}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks apart an implication into antecedent and consequent.

\DESCRIBE
{dest_imp} is a term destructor for implications. Thus
{
   dest_imp `t1 ==> t2`
}
\noindent returns
{
   (`t1`,`t2`)
}
\FAILURE
Fails with {dest_imp} if term is not an implication.

\COMMENTS
Previous version of {dest_imp} treats negations as an implication
with {F} as the conclusion. This is renamed to {dest_neg_imp}.

\SEEALSO
mk_imp, is_imp, strip_imp, dest_neg_imp.
