\DOC print_term

\TYPE {print_term : term -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a HOL term (without quotes) to the standard output.

\DESCRIBE
The call {print_term tm} prints the usual textual representation of the
term {tm} to the standard output. The string is just {tm} not {`tm`}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
Producing debugging output in complex rules. Note that terms are already
printed at the toplevel anyway, so it is not needed to examine results
interactively.
