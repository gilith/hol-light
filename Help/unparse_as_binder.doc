\DOC unparse_as_binder

\TYPE {unparse_as_binder : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Stops the quotation parser from treating a name as a binder.

\DESCRIBE
Certain identifiers {c} have binder status, meaning that {`c x. y`} is parsed
as a shorthand for {`(c) (\x. y)'}. The call {unparse_as_binder "c"} will
remove {c} from the list of binders if it is there.

\FAILURE
Never fails, even if the string was not a binder.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # `!x. x < 2`;;
  val it : term = `!x. x < 2`

  # unparse_as_binder "!";;
  val it : unit = ()
  # `!x. x < 2`;;
  Exception: Failure "Unexpected junk after term".
}

\COMMENTS
Removing binder status for the pre-existing binders like the quantifiers should
only be done with great care, since it can cause other parser invocations to
break.
