\DOC null_inst

\TYPE {null_inst : instantiation}

\SYNOPSIS
Empty instantiation.

\DESCRIBE
Several functions use objects of type {instantiation}, consisting of type and
term instantiations and higher-order matching information. This instantiation
{null_inst} is the trivial instantiation that does nothing.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\EXAMPLE
Instantiating a term with it has no effect: 
{
  # instantiate null_inst `x + 1 = 2`;;
  val it : term = `x + 1 = 2`
}

\SEEALSO
instantiate, INSTANTIATE, INSTANTIATE_ALL, term_match.
