\DOC ONCE_SIMP_TAC

\TYPE {ONCE_SIMP_TAC : thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplify conclusion of goal once by conditional contextual rewriting.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- g}, the tactic {ONCE_SIMP_TAC thl} returns a new
goal {A ?- g'} where {g'} results from applying the theorems in {thl} as
(conditional) rewrite rules, as well as built-in simplifications (see
{basic_rewrites} and {basic_convs}). For more details on this kind of
conditional rewriting, see {SIMP_CONV}. The {ONCE} prefix indicates that
the first applicable terms in a toplevel term will be simplified once only. 
Moreover, in contrast to the other simplification tactics, any unsolved 
subgoals arising from conditions on rewrites will be split off as new goals, 
allowing simplification to proceed more interactively.

\FAILURE
Never fails, though may not change the goal if no simplifications are
applicable.
