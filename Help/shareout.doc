\TYPE {shareout : 'a list list -> 'b list -> 'b list list}

\SYNOPSIS
Shares out the elements of the second list according to pattern in first.

\DESCRIBE
The call {shareout pat l} shares out the elements of {l} into the same groups 
as the pattern list {pat}, while keeping them in the same order. If there are 
more elements in {l} than needed, they will be discarded, but if there are 
fewer, failure will occur.

\FAILURE
Fails if there are too few elements in the second list.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # shareout [[1;2;3]; [4;5]; [6]; [7;8;9]] (explode "abcdefghijklmnopq");;
  val it : string list list =
    [["a"; "b"; "c"]; ["d"; "e"]; ["f"]; ["g"; "h"; "i"]]
}
