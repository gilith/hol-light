\DOC string_of_file

\TYPE {string_of_file : string -> string}

\SYNOPSIS
Read file and convert content into a string.

\DESCRIBE
When given a filename, the function {strings_of_file} attempts to open the file
for input, and if this is successful reads and closes it, returning the 
contents as a single string.

\FAILURE
Fails if the file cannot be opened (e.g. it does not exist, or the permissions
are wrong).

\EXAMPLE
If the file {/tmp/greeting} contains the text
{
Hello world
Goodbye world
}
\noindent then
{
  # string_of_file "/tmp/greeting";;
  val it : string = "Hello world\nGoodbye world"
}
