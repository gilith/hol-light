\DOC REPEAT_GTCL

\TYPE {REPEAT_GTCL : thm_tactical -> thm_tactical}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a theorem-tactical until it fails when applied to a goal.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem-tactical, a theorem-tactic, a theorem and a goal:
{
   REPEAT_GTCL ttl ttac th goal
}
\noindent {REPEAT_GTCL} repeatedly modifies the theorem according to
{ttl} till the result of handing it to {ttac} and applying it to the goal
fails (this may be no times at all).

\FAILURE
Fails iff the theorem-tactic fails immediately when applied to the theorem
and the goal.

\EXAMPLE
The following tactic matches {th}'s antecedents against the assumptions
of the goal until it can do so no longer, then puts the resolvents
onto the assumption list:
{
   REPEAT_GTCL IMP_RES_THEN ASSUME_TAC th
}
