\DOC mk_vartype

\TYPE {mk_vartype : string -> hol_type}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructs a type variable of the given name.

\DESCRIBE
{mk_vartype "A")} returns a type variable {`:A`}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # mk_vartype "Test";;
  val it : hol_type = `:Test`

  # mk_vartype "bool";;
  val it : hol_type = `:bool`
}
Note that the second type is {{\em not}} the inbuilt type of Booleans, even
though it prints like it.

\COMMENTS
{mk_vartype} can be used to create type variables with names which will not
parse, i.e. they cannot be entered by quotation. Using such type variables is
probably bad practice. HOL Light convention is to start type variables with an
uppercase letter.
