\DOC COMB2_CONV

\TYPE {COMB2_CONV : (term -> thm) -> (term -> thm) -> term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies two conversions to the two sides of an application.

\DESCRIBE
If {c1} and {c2} are conversions such that {c1 `f`} returns {|- f = f'} and
{c2 `x`} returns {|- x = x'}, then {COMB2_CONV c1 c2 `f x`} returns
{|- f x = f' x'}. That is, the conversions {c1} and {c2} are applied
respectively to the two immediate subterms.

\FAILURE
Never fails when applied to the initial conversions. On application to the term,
it fails if either {c1} or {c2} does, or if either returns a theorem that is of
the wrong form.
