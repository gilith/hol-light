\DOC GEN_TAC

\TYPE {GEN_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Strips the outermost universal quantifier from the conclusion of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- !x. t}, the tactic {GEN_TAC} reduces it to
{A ?- t[x'/x]} where {x'} is a variant of {x} chosen to avoid clashing with any
variables free in the goal's assumption list. Normally {x'} is just {x}.

     A ?- !x. t
   ==============  GEN_TAC
    A ?- t[x'/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal's conclusion is universally quantified.

\USES
The tactic {REPEAT GEN_TAC} strips away any universal quantifiers, and
is commonly used before tactics relying on the  underlying term structure.
