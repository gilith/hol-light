\DOC SPEC_ALL

\TYPE {SPEC_ALL : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem with its own quantified variables.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !x1...xn. t}, the inference rule {SPEC_ALL}
returns the theorem {A |- t[x1'/x1]...[xn'/xn]} where the {xi'} are distinct
variants of the corresponding {xi}, chosen to avoid clashes with any variables
free in the assumption list. Normally {xi'} is just {xi}, in which case
{SPEC_ALL} simply removes all universal quantifiers.
{
       A |- !x1...xn. t
   ---------------------------  SPEC_ALL
    A |- t[x1'/x1]...[xn'/xn]
}
\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
The following example shows how variables are also renamed to avoid clashing
with those in assumptions.
{
  # let th = ADD_ASSUM `m = 1` ADD_SYM;;
  val th : thm = m = 1 |- !m n. m + n = n + m

  # SPEC_ALL th;;
  val it : thm = m = 1 |- m' + n = n + m'
}
