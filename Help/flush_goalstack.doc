\DOC flush_goalstack

\TYPE {flush_goalstack : unit -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminate all but the current goalstate from the current goalstack.

\DESCRIBE
Normally, the current goalstack has the current goalstate at the head and all 
previous intermediate states further back in the list. This function 
{flush_goalstack()} keeps just the current goalstate and eliminates all 
previous states.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is no current goalstate, i.e. if the goalstack is empty.
