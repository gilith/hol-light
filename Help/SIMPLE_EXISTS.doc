\DOC SIMPLE_EXISTS

\TYPE {SIMPLE_EXISTS : term -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces an existential quantifier over a variable in a theorem.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a pair consisting of a variable {v} and a theorem {|- p}, 
{SIMPLE_EXISTS} returns the theorem {|- ?v. p}. It is not compulsory for {v} to 
appear free in {p}, but otherwise the quantification is vacuous.

\FAILURE
Fails only if {v} is not a variable.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # SIMPLE_EXISTS `x:num` (REFL `x:num`);;
  val it : thm = |- ?x. x = x
}

\COMMENTS
The {EXISTS} function is more general: it can introduce an existentially 
quantified variable to replace chosen instances of any term in the theorem. 
However, {SIMPLE_EXISTS} is easier to use when the simple case is needed.
