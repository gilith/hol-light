\DOC REAL_LINEAR_PROVER

\TYPE {REAL_LINEAR_PROVER : (thm list * thm list * thm list -> positivstellensatz -> thm) -> thm list * thm list * thm list -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Refute real equations and inequations by linear reasoning (not intended for
general use).

\DESCRIBE
The {REAL_LINEAR_PROVER} function should be given two arguments. The first is a
proof translator that constructs a contradiction from a tuple of three theorem
lists using a Positivstellensatz refutation, which is essentially a
representation of how to add and multiply equalities or inequalities chosen
from the list to reach a trivially false equation or inequality such as 
{&0 > &0}. The second argument is a triple of theorem lists, respectively a
list of equations of the form {A_i |- p_i = &0}, a list of non-strict
inequalities of the form {B_j |- q_i >= &0}, and a list of strict inequalities
of the form {C_k |- r_k > &0}, with both sides being real in each case. Any
theorems not of that form will not lead to an error, but will be ignored and
cannot contribute to the proof. The prover attempts to construct a
Positivstellensatz refutation by normalization as in {REAL_POLY_CONV} then
linear inequality reasoning, and if successful will apply the translator
function to this refutation to obtain {D |- F} where all assumptions {D} occurs
among the {A_i}, {B_j} or {C_k}. Otherwise, or if the translator itself fails,
the call fails.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is no refutation using linear reasoning or if an improper form
inhibits proof for other reasons, or if the translator fails.

\USES
This is not intended for general use. The core real inequality reasoner
{REAL_ARITH} is implemented by:
{
  # let REAL_ARITH = GEN_REAL_ARITH REAL_LINEAR_PROVER;;
}
In this way, all specifically linear functionality is isolated in
{REAL_LINEAR_PROVER}, and the rest of the infrastructure of Positivstellensatz
proof translation and initial normalization (including elimination of {abs},
{max}, {min}, conditional expressions etc.) is available for use with more
advanced nonlinear provers. Such a prover, based on semidefinite programming
and requiring support of an external SDP solver to find Positivstellensatz
refutations, can be found in {Examples/sos.ml}.
