\TYPE {is_gabs : term -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests if a term is a basic or generalized abstraction.

\DESCRIBE
The call {is_gabs t} tests if {t} is either a basic logical abstraction (as
identified by {is_abs}) or a generalized one (a standard composite logical
structure to support a non-variable vastruct). If so, it returns {true}, and
otherwise it returns {false}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
This shows that ordinary abstractions are allowed:
{
  # is_gabs `\x. x + 1`;;
  val it : bool = true
}
\noindent while the following shows a more typical case:
{
  # is_gabs `\(x,y,z). x + y + z + 1`;;
  val it : bool = true
}
