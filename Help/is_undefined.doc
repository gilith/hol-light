\DOC is_undefined

\TYPE {is_undefined : ('a, 'b) func -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests if a finite partial function is defined nowhere.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of a suite of operations on finite partial functions, type
{('a,'b)func}. These may sometimes be preferable to ordinary functions since
they permit more operations such as equality comparison, extraction of domain
etc. The predicate {is_undefined} tests if the argument is the completely
undefined function.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # let x = undefined and y = (1 |=> 2);;
  val x : ('a, 'b) func = <func>
  val y : (int, int) func = <func>

  # is_undefined x;;
  val it : bool = true

  # is_undefined y;;
  val it : bool = false
}
