\TYPE {typify_universal_set : bool ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Determines whether the universe set on a type is printed just as the type.

\DESCRIBE
The reference variable {typify_universal_set} is one of several
settable parameters controlling printing of terms by {pp_print_term}, and hence
the automatic printing of terms and theorems at the toplevel. When it is 
{true}, as it is by default, any universal set {UNIV:A->bool} ({UNIV} is a
predefined set constant valid over all types) is printed just as {(:A)}. When
{typify_universal_set} is {false}, it is printed as {UNIV}, just as for any 
other constant.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\EXAMPLE
Note that having this setting is quite useful here:
{
  # CART_EQ;;
  val it : thm =
    |- !x y. x = y <=> (!i. 1 <= i /\ i <= dimindex (:B) ==> x $ i = y $ i)
}

\USES
HOL Light's Cartesian power type (constructor `{^}') uses a type to index the 
power. When this flag is {true}, formulas often become easier to understand 
when printed, as in the above example.
