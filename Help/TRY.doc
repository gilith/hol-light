\TYPE {TRY : tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes a tactic have no effect rather than fail.

\KEYWORDS
tactical, failure.

\DESCRIBE
For any tactic {t}, the application {TRY t} gives a new tactic
which has the same effect as {t} if that succeeds, and otherwise has
no effect.

\FAILURE
The application of {TRY} to a tactic never fails. The resulting
tactic never fails.

\EXAMPLE
We might want to try a certain tactic ``speculatively'', even if we're not sure 
that it will work, for example, to handle the ``easy'' subgoals from breaking 
apart a large conjunction. On a small scale, we might want to prove:
{
  # g `(x + 1) EXP 2 = x EXP 2 + 2 * x + 1 /\
       (x EXP 2 = y EXP 2 ==> x = y) /\
       (x < y ==> 2 * x + 1 < 2 * y)`;;
  ...
}
\noindent and just see which conjuncts we can get rid of automatically by 
{ARITH_TAC}. It turns out that it only leaves one subgoal with some nonlinear 
reasoning:
{
  # e(REPEAT CONJ_TAC THEN TRY ARITH_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)
  
  `x EXP 2 = y EXP 2 ==> x = y`
}
