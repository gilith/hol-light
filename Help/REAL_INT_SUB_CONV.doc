\DOC REAL_INT_SUB_CONV

\TYPE {REAL_INT_SUB_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Conversion to perform subtraction on two integer literals of type {:real}.

\DESCRIBE
The call {REAL_INT_SUB_CONV `c1 - c2`} where {c1} and {c2} are integer literals
of type {:real}, returns {|- c1 - c2 = d} where {d} is the canonical integer
literal that is equal to {c1 - c2}. The literals {c1} and {c2} may be of the
form {&n} or {-- &n} (with nonzero {n} in the latter case) and the result will
be of the same form.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not the difference of two permitted integer
literals of type {:real}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # REAL_INT_SUB_CONV `&33 - &77`;;
  val it : thm = |- &33 - &77 = -- &44
}

\COMMENTS
The related function {REAL_RAT_SUB_CONV} subsumes this functionality, also
applying to rational literals. Unless the restriction to integers is desired or
a tiny efficiency difference matters, it should be used in preference.
