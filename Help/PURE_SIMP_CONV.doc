\DOC PURE_SIMP_CONV

\TYPE {PURE_SIMP_CONV : thm list -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplify a term repeatedly by conditional contextual rewriting, not using 
default simplifications.

\DESCRIBE
A call {SIMP_CONV thl tm} will return {|- tm = tm'} where {tm'} results from
applying the theorems in {thl} as (conditional) rewrite rules. This is similar
to {SIMP_CONV}, and the documentation for that contains more details. The
{PURE} prefix means that the usual built-in simplifications (see
{basic_rewrites} and {basic_convs}) are not applied.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but may return a reflexive theorem {|- tm = tm} if no
simplifications can be made.
