\DOC preterm_of_term

\TYPE {preterm_of_term : term -> preterm}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a term into a preterm.

\DESCRIBE
HOL Light uses ``pretypes'' and ``preterms'' as intermediate structures for 
parsing and typechecking, which are later converted to types and terms. A call 
{preterm_of_term `tm`} converts in the other direction, from a normal HOL term
back to a preterm.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
User manipulation of preterms is not usually necessary, unless you seek to 
radically change aspects of parsing and typechecking.            

\SEEALSO
pretype_of_type, term_of_preterm.
