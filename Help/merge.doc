\TYPE {merge : ('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list}

\SYNOPSIS
Merges together two sorted lists with respect to a given ordering.

\DESCRIBE
If two lists {l1} and {l2} are sorted with respect to the given ordering {ord}, 
then {merge ord l1 l2} will merge them into a sorted list of all the elements. 
The merge keeps any duplicates; it is not a set operation.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but if the lists are not appropriately sorted the results will not 
in general be correct.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # merge (<) [1;2;3;4;5;6] [2;4;6;8];;
  val it : int list = [1; 2; 2; 3; 4; 4; 5; 6; 6; 8]
}
