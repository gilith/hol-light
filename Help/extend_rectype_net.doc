\TYPE {extend_rectype_net : string * ('a * 'b * thm) -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Extends internal store of distinctness and injectivity theorems for a new 
inductive type.

\DESCRIBE
HOL Light maintains several data structures based on the current set of 
distinctness and injectivity theorems for the inductive data type so far 
defined. A call {extend_rectype_net ("tyname",(_,_,rth))} where {rth} is the 
recursion theorem for the type as returned as the second item from 
{define_type}, extend these structures for a new type. Two arguments are 
ignored just for regularity with some other internal data structures.

\FAILURE
Never fails, even if the theorem is malformed.

\COMMENTS
This functoin is called automatically by {define_type}, and normally users will
not need to invoke it explicitly.
