\TYPE {ASM_FOL_TAC : (string * thm) list * term -> goalstate}

\SYNOPSIS
Fix up function arities for first-order proof search.

\DESCRIBE
This function attempts to make the assumptions of a goal more `first-order'. 
Functions that are not consistently used with the same arity, e.g. a function 
{f} that is sometimes applied {f(a)} and sometimes used as an argument to other 
functions, {g(f)}, will be identified. Applications of the function will then 
be modified by the introduction of the identity function {I} (which can be
thought of later as binary `function application') so that {f(a)} becomes 
{I f a}. This gives a more natural formulation as a prelude to traditional
first-order proof search.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
This function is not intended for general use, but is part of the initial
normalization in {MESON} and {MESON_TAC}.
