\DOC reserve_words

\TYPE {reserve_words : string list -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Add given strings to the set of reserved words.

\DESCRIBE
Certain identifiers in HOL are reserved, e.g. `{if}', `{let}' and `{|}', 
meaning that they are special to the parser and cannot be used as ordinary 
identifiers. A call {reserve_words l} adds all strings in {l} to the list of
reserved identifiers.

\FAILURE
Never fails, regardless of whether the given strings were already reserved.
