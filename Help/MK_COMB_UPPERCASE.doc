\DOC MK_COMB

\TYPE {MK_COMB : thm * thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equality of combinations constructed from equal
functions and operands.

\KEYWORDS
rule, combination, equality.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to theorems {A1 |- f = g} and {A2 |- x = y}, the inference
rule {MK_COMB} returns the theorem {A1 u A2 |- f x = g y}.
{
    A1 |- f = g   A2 |- x = y
   ---------------------------  MK_COMB
       A1 u A2 |- f x = g y
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless both theorems are equational and {f} and {g} are
functions whose domain types are the same as the types of {x} and {y}
respectively.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # TRANS (ASSUME `0 = 1`) (ASSUME `1 = 2`);;
  val it : thm = 0 = 1, 1 = 2 |- 0 = 2
}

\COMMENTS
This is one of HOL Light's 10 primitive inference rules. It underlies, among
other things, the replacement of subterms in rewriting.
