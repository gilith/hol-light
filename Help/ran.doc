\DOC ran

\TYPE {ran : ('a, 'b) func -> 'b list}

This is one of a suite of operations on finite partial functions, type
{('a,'b)func}. These may sometimes be preferable to ordinary functions since
they permit more operations such as equality comparison, extraction of domain
etc. The {ran} operation returns the range of such a function, i.e. the set of
result values for the points on which it is defined.

\FAILURE
Attempts to {setify} the resulting list, so may fail if the range type does not
admit comparisons.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # ran (1 |=> "1");;
  val it : string list = ["1"]
  # ran(itlist I [2|->4; 3|->6] undefined);;
  val it : int list = [4; 6]
}
