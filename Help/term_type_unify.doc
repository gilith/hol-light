\DOC term_type_unify

\TYPE {term_type_unify : term -> term -> instantiation -> instantiation}

\SYNOPSIS
Unify two terms including their type variables

\DESCRIBE
Given two terms {tm1} and {tm2} and an existing instantiation {i} of type and 
term variables, a call {term_type_unify tm1 tm2 i} attempts to find an
augmentation of the instantiation {i} that makes the terms alpha-equivalent.
The unification is purely first-order.

\FAILURE
Fails if the two terms are not first-order unifiable by instantiating the given
variables and type variables.

\COMMENTS
The more restrictive {term_unify} does a similar job when the type variables 
are already compatible and only terms need to be instantiated.
