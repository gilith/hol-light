\DOC PURE_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {PURE_REWRITE_RULE : thm list -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem with only the given list of rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
This rule provides a method for rewriting a theorem with the theorems given,
and excluding simplification with tautologies in {basic_rewrites}. Matching
subterms are found recursively starting from the term in the conclusion part of
the theorem, until no more matches are found. For more details on rewriting see
{GEN_REWRITE_RULE}.

\USES
{PURE_REWRITE_RULE} is useful when the simplifications that arise by
rewriting a theorem with {basic_rewrites} are not wanted.

\FAILURE
Does not fail. May result in divergence, in which case
{PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_RULE} can be used.
