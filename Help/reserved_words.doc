\DOC reserved_words

\TYPE {reserved_words : unit -> string list}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the list of reserved words.

\DESCRIBE
Certain identifiers in HOL are reserved, e.g. `{if}', `{let}' and `{|}', 
meaning that they are special to the parser and cannot be used as ordinary 
identifiers. The call {reserved_words()} returns a list of such identifiers.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
In the default HOL state:
{
  # reserved_words();;
  val it : string list =
    ["("; ")"; "["; "]"; "{"; "}"; ":"; ";"; "."; "|"; "let"; "in"; "and";
     "if"; "then"; "else"; "//"]
}
