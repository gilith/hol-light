\DOC string_of_term

\TYPE {string_of_term : term -> string}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a HOL term to a string representation.

\DESCRIBE
The call {string_of_term tm} produces a textual representation of the term {tm}
as a string, similar to what is printed automatically at the toplevel, though 
without the surrounding quotes.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # string_of_term `x + 1 < 2 <=> x = 0`;;
  val it : string = "x + 1 < 2 <=> x = 0"
}

\COMMENTS
The string may contain newlines for large terms, broken in a similar fashion to 
automatic printing.

\SEEALSO
