\DOC term_of_preterm

\TYPE {term_of_preterm : preterm -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a preterm into a term.

\DESCRIBE
HOL Light uses ``pretypes'' and ``preterms'' as intermediate structures for 
parsing and typechecking, which are later converted to types and terms. A call 
{term_of_preterm ptm} attempts to convert preterm {ptm} into a HOL term.

\FAILURE
Fails if some constants used in the preterm have not been defined, or if there 
are other inconsistencies in the types so that a consistent typing cannot be 
arrived at.

\COMMENTS
Only users seeking to change HOL's parser and typechecker quite radically need 
to use this function.
