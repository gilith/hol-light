\DOC freesl

\TYPE {freesl : term list -> term list}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of the free variables in a list of terms.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of terms, {freesl} returns a list of the variables which
are free in any of those terms. There are no repetitions in the list produced
even if several terms contain the same free variable.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
In the following example there are free instances of each of {w}, {x} and {y},
whereas the only instances of {z} are bound:
{
  # freesl [`x + y = 2`; `!z. z >= x - w`];;
  val it : term list = [`y`; `x`; `w`]
}
