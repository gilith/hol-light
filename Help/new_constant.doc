\DOC new_constant

\TYPE {new_constant : string * hol_type -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new constant.

\DESCRIBE
A call {new_constant("c",`:ty`)} makes {c} a constant with most general type 
{ty}.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is already a constant of that name in the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{

  #new_constant("graham's_number",`:num`);;
  val it : unit = ()
}

\USES
Can be useful for declaring some arbitrary parameter, but more usually a 
prelude to some new axioms about the constant introduced. Take care when using 
{new_axiom}!
