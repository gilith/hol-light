\TYPE {help : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Displays help on a given identifier in the system.

\DESCRIBE
A call {help "s"} will attempt to display the help file associated with a
particular identifier {s} in the system. If there is no entry for identifier
{s}, the call responds instead with some possibly helpful suggestions as to
what you might have meant, based on a simple `edit distance' criterion.

The built-in help files are stored in the {Help} subdirectory of HOL Light. 
Users can add additional locations by modifying {help_path}. Normally the help
file for an identifier {name} would be called {name.doc}, but there are a few
exceptions, because some identifiers have characters that cannot be put in
filenames and some platforms like Cygwin have inadequate case sensitivity.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
Here is a successful call:
{
  # help "lhs";;
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  lhs : term -> term

  SYNOPSIS

  Returns the left-hand side of an equation.

  DESCRIPTION

  lhs `t1 = t2` returns `t1`.

  FAILURE CONDITIONS

  Fails with lhs if the term is not an equation.

  EXAMPLES


    # lhs `2 + 2 = 4`;;
    val it : term = `2 + 2`

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  val it : unit = ()
}
\noindent and here is one for a non-existent identifier:
{
  # help "IMP_TAC";;
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  No help found for "IMP_TAC"; did you mean:

  help "SIMP_TAC";;
  help "MP_TAC";;
  help "IMP_TRANS";;

  ?

}
