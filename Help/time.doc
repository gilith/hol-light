\TYPE {time : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b}

\SYNOPSIS
Report CPU time taken by a function.

\DESCRIBE
A call {time f x} will evaluate {f x} as usual, but will also (provided the 
{report_timing} flag is {true} as it is by default) print the CPU time taken by 
that function evaluation.

\FAILURE
Never fails in itself, though it propagates any exception generated by the call 
{f x} itself.

\EXAMPLE
{
  #  time NUM_REDUCE_CONV `123 EXP 14`;;
  CPU time (user): 0.09
  val it : thm = |- 123 EXP 14 = 181414317867238075368413196009
}

\USES
Monitoring CPU time taken, e.g. to test different algorithms or implementation 
optimizations.
