\DOC meson_split_limit

\TYPE {meson_split_limit : int ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Limit initial case splits before {MESON} proper is applied.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of several parameters determining the behavior of {MESON},
{MESON_TAC} and related rules and tactics. Before these rules or tactics are 
applied, the formula to be proved is often decomposed by splitting, for example 
an equivalence {p <=> q} to two separate implications {p ==> q} and {q ==> p}. 
This often makes the eventual proof much easier for {MESON}. On the other hand, 
if splitting is applied too many times, it can become inefficient. The value
{meson_split_limit} (default {8}) is the maximum number of times that splitting 
can be applied before {MESON} proper.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\USES
For users requiring fine control over the algorithms used in {MESON}'s 
first-order proof search.
