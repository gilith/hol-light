\TYPE {inst_goal : instantiation -> goal -> goal}

\SYNOPSIS
Apply higher-order instantiation to a goal.

\DESCRIBE
The call {inst_goal i g} where {i} is an instantiation (as returned by
{term_match} for example), will perform the instantiation indicated by {i} in
both assumptions and conclusion of the goal {g}.

\FAILURE
Should never fail on a valid instantiation.

\COMMENTS
Probably only of specialist interest to those writing tactics from scratch.
