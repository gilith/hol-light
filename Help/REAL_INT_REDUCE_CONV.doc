\DOC REAL_INT_REDUCE_CONV

\TYPE {REAL_INT_REDUCE_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Evaluate subexpressions built up from integer literals of type {:real}, by
proof.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term, {REAL_INT_REDUCE_CONV} performs a recursive bottom-up
evaluation by proof of subterms built from integer literals of type {:real}
using the unary operators `{--}', `{inv}' and `{abs}', and the binary
arithmetic (`{+}', `{-}', `{*}', `{/}', `{pow}') and relational (`{<}', `{<=}',
`{>}', `{>=}', `{=}') operators, as well as propagating literals through
logical operations, e.g. {T /\ x <=> x}, returning a theorem that the original
and reduced terms are equal. The permissible integer literals are of the form 
{&n} or {-- &n} for numeral {n}, nonzero in the negative case.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but may have no effect.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # REAL_INT_REDUCE_CONV
     `if &5 pow 4 < &4 pow 5 then (&2 pow 3 - &1) pow 2 + &1 else &99`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (if &5 pow 4 < &4 pow 5 then (&2 pow 3 - &1) pow 2 + &1 else &99) = &50
}

\COMMENTS
The corresponding {INT_REDUCE_CONV} works for the type of integers. The more
general function {REAL_RAT_REDUCE_CONV} works similarly over {:real} but for
arbitrary rational literals.
