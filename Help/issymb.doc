\TYPE {issymb : string -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests if a one-character string is a symbol other than bracket or separator.

\DESCRIBE
The call {issymb s} tests whether the first character of string {s} (normally 
it is the only character) is ``symbolic''. This means that it is one of the 
usual ASCII characters but is not alphanumeric, not an underscore or prime
character, and is also not one of the two separators `{,}' or `{;}' nor any
bracket, parenthesis or curly brace. More explicitly, the set of symbolic 
characters is:
{
  \ ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + | \ \ < = > / ? ~ . :
}

\FAILURE
Fails if the string is empty.
