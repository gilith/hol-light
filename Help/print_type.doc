\DOC print_type

\TYPE {print_type : hol_type -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a type (without colon or quotes) to standard output.

\DESCRIBE
The call {print_type ty} prints the usual textual representation of the
type {ty} to the standard output. The string is just {ty} not {`:ty`}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
Producing debugging output in complex rules. Note that terms are already
printed at the toplevel anyway, so it is not needed to examine results
interactively.
