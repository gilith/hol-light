\DOC EVERY_ASSUM

\TYPE {EVERY_ASSUM : thm_tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Sequentially applies all tactics given by mapping a function over the
assumptions of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical, assumption.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem-tactic {f} and a goal {({{A1;...;An}} ?- C)}, the
{EVERY_ASSUM} tactical maps {f} over the list of assumptions then
applies the resulting tactics, in sequence, to the goal:
{
   EVERY_ASSUM f ({{A1;...;An}} ?- C)
    = (f(.. |- A1) THEN ... THEN f(.. |- An)) ({{A1;...;An}} ?- C)
}
\noindent If the goal has no assumptions, then {EVERY_ASSUM} has no effect.

\FAILURE
The application of {EVERY_ASSUM} to a theorem-tactic and a goal fails
if the theorem-tactic fails when applied to any of the assumptions of the goal,
or if any of the resulting tactics fail when applied sequentially.
