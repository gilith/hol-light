\DOC loadt

\TYPE {loadt : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Finds a file on the load path and loads it.

\DESCRIBE
The function {loadt} takes a string indicating an OCaml file name as
argument and loads it. If the filename is relative, it is found on the load
path {load_path}, and it is then loaded, updating the list of loaded files.

\FAILURE
{loadt} will fail if the file named by the argument does not exist in
the search path. It will of course fail if the file is not a valid OCaml
file. Failure in the OCaml file will also terminate loading.

\EXAMPLE
If we have an ML file called {foo.ml} on the load path, e.g. in the current
directory, which contains the line
{
   let x=2+2;;
}
\noindent this can be loaded as follows:
{
   # loadt "foo.ml";;
}
\noindent and the system would respond with:
{
  # loadt "foo.ml";;
  val x : int = 4
  val it : unit = ()
}
