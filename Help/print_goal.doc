\DOC print_goal

\TYPE {print_goal : goal -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Print a goal.

\DESCRIBE
{print_goalstack g} prints the goal {g} to standard output, with no following
newline.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
This is invoked automatically when something of type {goal} is produced at
the top level, so manual invocation is not normally needed.
