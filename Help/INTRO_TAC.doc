\DOC INTRO_TAC

\TYPE {INTRO_TAC : string -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks down outer quantifiers in goal, introducing variables and named
hypotheses.

\DESCRIBE
Given a string {s}, {INTRO_TAC s} breaks down outer universal quantifiers and
implications in the goal, fixing variables and introducing assumptions with
names. It combines several forms of introduction of logical connectives. The
introduction pattern uses the following syntax:

\begin{{itemize}}

\item {! fix_pattern} introduces universally quantified variables as with
   {FIX_TAC}

\item a destruct pattern introduces and destructs an implication as with
   {DESTRUCT_TAC}

\item {#n} selects disjunct {n} in the goal

\end{{itemize}}

Several fix patterns and intro patterns can be combined sequentially,
separed by semicolons `;'.

\FAILURE
Fails if the pattern is ill-formed or does not match the form of the goal.

\EXAMPLE
Here we introduce the universally quantified outer variables, assume the
antecedent, splitting apart conjunctions and disjunctions:
{
  # g `!p q r. p \/ (q /\ r) ==> p /\ q \/ p /\ r`;;
  # e (INTRO_TAC "!p q r; p | q r");;
  val it : goalstack = 2 subgoals (2 total)

    0 [`q`] (q)
    1 [`r`] (r)

  `p /\ q \/ p /\ r`

    0 [`p`] (p)

  `p /\ q \/ p /\ r`
}
Now a further step will select the first disjunct to prove in the top goal:
{
  # e (INTRO_TAC "#1");;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (2 total)

    0 [`p`] (p)

  `p /\ q`
}

Here we fix an automatically generated variable, choosing a meaningful name
for it, and we introduce a labeled hypothesis in a single command:
{
  # g `(@x. x = 0) + 0 = 0`;;
  # e SELECT_ELIM_TAC;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)
  
  `!_75725. (!x. x = 0 ==> _75725 = 0) ==> _75725 + 0 = 0`
  
  # e (INTRO_TAC "![y]; hp");;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)
  
    0 [`!x. x = 0 ==> y = 0`] (hp)
  
  `y + 0 = 0`
}
