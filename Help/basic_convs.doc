\DOC basic_convs

\TYPE {basic_convs : unit -> (string * (term * conv)) list}

\SYNOPSIS
List the current default conversions used in rewriting and simplification.

\DESCRIBE
The HOL Light rewriter ({REWRITE_TAC} etc.) and simplifier ({SIMP_TAC} etc.) 
have default sets of (conditional) equations and other conversions that are 
applied by default, except in the {PURE_} variants. A call to {basic_convs()} 
returns the current set of conversions.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
In the default HOL Light state the only conversion is for generalized beta 
reduction. All the other default simplifications are done by rewrite rules.
{
  # basic_convs();;
  val it : (string * (term * conv)) list =
    [("GEN_BETA_CONV", (`GABS (\a. b) c`, <fun>))]
}
