\TYPE {parse_preterm : lexcode list -> preterm * lexcode list}

\SYNOPSIS
Parses a preterm.

\DESCRIBE
The call {parse_preterm t}, where {t} is a list of lexical tokens (as produced
by {lex}), parses the tokens and returns a preterm as well as the unparsed
tokens.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is a syntax error in the token list.

\USES
This is mostly an internal function; pretypes and preterms are used as an
intermediate representation for typechecking and overload resolution and are
not normally of concern to users.

\SEEALSO
lex, parse_pretype, parse_term, parse_type.
