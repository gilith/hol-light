\DOC UNDISCH_THEN

\TYPE {UNDISCH_THEN : term -> thm_tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Undischarges an assumption and applies theorem-tactic to it.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic {UNDISCH_THEN `a` ttac} applied to a goal {A |- t} takes {a} out of
the assumptions to give a goal {A - {{a}} |- t}, and applies the theorem-tactic
{ttac} to the assumption {.. |- a} and that new goal.

\FAILURE
Fails if {a} is not an assumption; when applied to the goal it fails exactly if 
the theorem-tactic fails on the modified goal.

\COMMENTS
The tactic {UNDISCH_TAC `t`} can be considered the special case of
{UNDISCH_THEN `t` MP_TAC}.
