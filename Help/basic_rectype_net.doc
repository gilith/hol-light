\TYPE {basic_rectype_net : (int * (term -> thm)) net ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Net of injectivity and distinctness properties for recursive type constructors.

\DESCRIBE
HOL Light maintains a net of theorems used to simplify equations between
elements of recursive datatypes; essentially these include injectivity and
distinctness, e.g. {CONS_11} and {NOT_CONS_NIL} for lists. This net is used in
some situations where such things need to be proved automatically, notably in
{define}. A call to {basic_rectype_net()} returns that net. It is automatically
updated whenever a type is defined by {define_type}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
