\DOC set_basic_congs

\TYPE {set_basic_congs : thm list -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Change the set of basic congruences used by the simplifier.

\DESCRIBE
The HOL Light simplifier (as invoked by {SIMP_TAC} etc.) uses congruence rules 
to determine how it uses context when descending through a term. These are 
essentially theorems showing how to decompose one equality to a series of other 
inequalities in context. A call to {set_basic_congs thl} sets the congruence 
rules to the list of theorems {thl}. 

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
Normally, users only need to extend the congruences; for an example of how to 
do that see {extend_basic_congs}.
