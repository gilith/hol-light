\TYPE {INT_POW_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Conversion to perform exponentiation on a integer literal of type {:int}.

\DESCRIBE
The call {INT_POW_CONV `c pow n`} where {c} is an integer literal of type
{:int} and {n} is a numeral of type {:num}, returns {|- c pow n = d} where {d}
is the canonical integer literal that is equal to {c} raised to the {n}th
power. The literal {c} may be of the form {&n} or {-- &n} (with nonzero {n} in
the latter case) and the result will be of the same form.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not a permitted integer literal of type
{:int} raised to a numeral power.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # INT_POW_CONV `(-- &2) pow 77`;;
  val it : thm = |- -- &2 pow 77 = -- &151115727451828646838272
