\DOC CONV_RULE

\TYPE {CONV_RULE : conv -> thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes an inference rule from a conversion.

\KEYWORDS
conversional, rule.

\DESCRIBE
If {c} is a conversion, then {CONV_RULE c} is an inference rule that applies
{c} to the conclusion of a theorem.  That is, if {c} maps a term {`t`} to the
theorem {|- t = t'}, then the rule {CONV_RULE c} infers {|- t'} from the
theorem {|- t}.  More precisely, if {c `t`} returns {A' |- t = t'}, then:
{
       A |- t
   --------------  CONV_RULE c
    A u A' |- t'
}
\noindent Note that if the conversion {c} returns a theorem with assumptions,
then the resulting inference rule adds these to the assumptions of the
theorem it returns.

\FAILURE
{CONV_RULE c th} fails if {c} fails when applied to the conclusion of {th}. The
function returned by {CONV_RULE c} will also fail if the ML function {c} is
not, in fact, a conversion (i.e. a function that maps a term {t} to a theorem
{|- t = t'}).

\EXAMPLE
{
  # CONV_RULE BETA_CONV (ASSUME `(\x. x < 2) 1`);;
  val it : thm = (\x. x < 2) 1 |- 1 < 2
}
