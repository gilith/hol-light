\TYPE {get_infix_status : string -> int * string}

\SYNOPSIS
Get the precedence and associativity of an infix operator.

\DESCRIBE
Certain identifiers are treated as infix operators with a given precedence and 
associativity (left or right). The call {get_infix_status "op"} looks up {op} 
in this list and returns a pair consisting of its precedence and its 
associativity; the latteris one of the strings {"left"} or {"right"}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the given string does not have infix status.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # get_infix_status "/";;
  val it : int * string = (22, "left")
  # get_infix_status "UNION";;
  val it : int * string = (16, "right")
}
