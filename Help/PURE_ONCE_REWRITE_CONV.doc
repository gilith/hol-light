\DOC PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_CONV

\TYPE {PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_CONV : thm list -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a term once with only the given list of rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
{PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_CONV} generates rewrites from the list of theorems
supplied by the user, without including the tautologies given in
{basic_rewrites}. The applicable rewrites are employed once, without
entailing in a recursive search for matches over the term.
See {GEN_REWRITE_CONV} for more details about rewriting strategies in
HOL.

\FAILURE
This rule does not fail, and it does not diverge.
