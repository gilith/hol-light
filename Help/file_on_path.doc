\DOC file_on_path

\TYPE {file_on_path : string list -> string -> string}

\SYNOPSIS
Expands relative filename to first available one in path.

\DESCRIBE
When given an absolute filename, (e.g. on Linux/Unix one starting with a slash
or tilde), this function returns it unchanged. Otherwise it tries to find the
file in one of the directories in the path argument. An initial dollar sign {$}
in each path is interpreted as a reference to the current setting of {hol_dir}.
To get an actual {$} at the start of the filename, actually use two dollar
signs {$$}.

\FAILURE
Fails if no file is found on the path.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # file_on_path (!load_path) "Library/analysis.ml";;
  val it : string = "/home/johnh/holl/Library/analysis.ml"
  # file_on_path (!load_path) "Library/wibble.ml";;
  Exception: Not_found.
}
