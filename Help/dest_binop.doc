\DOC dest_binop

\TYPE {dest_binop : term -> term -> term * term}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks apart an application of a given binary operator to two arguments.

\DESCRIBE
The call {dest_binop op t}, where {t} is of the form {(op l) r}, will return 
the pair {l,r}. If {t} is not of that form, it fails. Note that {op} can be any 
term; it need not be a constant nor parsed infix.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not a binary application of operator {op}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # dest_binop `(+):num->num->num` `1 + 2 + 3`;;
  val it : term * term = (`1`, `2 + 3`)
}
