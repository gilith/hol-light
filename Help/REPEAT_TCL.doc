\DOC REPEAT_TCL

\TYPE {REPEAT_TCL : thm_tactical -> thm_tactical}

\SYNOPSIS
Repeatedly applies a theorem-tactical until it fails when applied to the
theorem.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem-tactical, a theorem-tactic and a theorem:
{
   REPEAT_TCL ttl ttac th
}
\noindent {REPEAT_TCL} repeatedly modifies the theorem according to {ttl}
until it fails when given to the theorem-tactic {ttac}.

\FAILURE
Fails iff the theorem-tactic fails immediately when applied to the theorem.

\EXAMPLE
It is often desirable to repeat the action of basic theorem-tactics. For
example {CHOOSE_THEN} strips off a single existential quantification, so one
might use {REPEAT_TCL CHOOSE_THEN} to get rid of them all.

Alternatively, one might want to repeatedly break apart a theorem which is a
nested conjunction and apply the same theorem-tactic to each conjunct. For
example the following goal:
{
  # g `(0 = w /\ 0 = x) /\ 0 = y /\ 0 = z ==> w + x + y + z = 0`;;
  Warning: Free variables in goal: w, x, y, z
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)

  `(0 = w /\ 0 = x) /\ 0 = y /\ 0 = z ==> w + x + y + z = 0`
}
\noindent might be solved by
{
  # e(DISCH_THEN (REPEAT_TCL CONJUNCTS_THEN (SUBST1_TAC o SYM)) THEN
      REWRITE_TAC[ADD_CLAUSES]);;
}
