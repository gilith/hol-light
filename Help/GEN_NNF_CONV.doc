\TYPE {GEN_NNF_CONV : bool -> conv * (term -> thm * thm) -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
General NNF (negation normal form) conversion.

\DESCRIBE
The function {GEN_NNF_CONV} is a highly general conversion for putting a term
in `negation normal form' (NNF). This means that other propositional
connectives are eliminated in favour of conjunction (`{/\}'), disjunction
(`{\/}') and negation (`{~}'), and the negations are pushed down to the level
of atomic formulas, also through universal and existential quantifiers, with
double negations eliminated.

This function is very general. The first, boolean, argument determines how
logical equivalences `{p <=> q}' are split. If the flag is {true}, toplevel
equivalences are split ``conjunctively'' into `{(p \/ ~q) /\ (~p \/ q)}', while
if it is false they are split ``disjunctively'' into 
`{(p /\ q) \/ (~p /\ ~q)}'. At subformulas, the effect is modified
appropriately in order to make the resulting formula simpler in conjunctive
normal form (if the flag is true) or disjunctive normal form (if the flag is
false).

The second argument has two components. The first is a conversion to apply to
literals, that is atomic formulas or their negations. The second is a slightly
more elaborate variant of the same thing, taking an atomic formula {p} and
returning desired equivalences for both {p} and {~p} in a pair. This interface
avoids multiple recomputations in terms involving many nested logical
equivalences, where otherwise the core conversion would be called several
times.

\FAILURE
Never fails but may have no effect.

\COMMENTS
The simple functions like {NNF_CONV} should be adequate most of the time, with
this somewhat intricate interface being reserved for special situations.
