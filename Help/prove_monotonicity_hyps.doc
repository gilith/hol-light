\DOC prove_monotonicity_hyps

\TYPE {prove_monotonicity_hyps : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempt to prove monotonicity hypotheses of theorem automatically.

\DESCRIBE
Given a theorem {A |- t}, the rule {prove_monotonicity_hyps} attempts to prove 
and remove all hypotheses that are not equations, by breaking them down and 
repeatedly using {MONO_TAC}. Any that are equations or are not automatically 
provable will be left as they are.

\FAILURE
Never fails but may have no effect.

\COMMENTS
Normally, this kind of reasoning is automated by the inductive definitions 
package, so explicit use of this tactic is rare.
