\TYPE {meson_depth : bool ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Make {MESON}'s search algorithm work by proof depth rather than size.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of several parameters determining the behavior of {MESON},
{MESON_TAC} and related rules and tactics. The basic search strategy is 
iterated deepening, searching for proofs with higher and higher limits on the 
search space. The flag {meson_depth}, when set to {true}, limits the search
space based on proof depth, i.e. the longest branch. When set to {false}, as it
is by default, the proof is limited based on total size.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\USES
For users requiring fine control over the algorithms used in {MESON}'s 
first-order proof search.
