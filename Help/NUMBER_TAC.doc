\TYPE {NUMBER_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Automated tactic for elementary divisibility properties over the natural
numbers.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic {NUMBER_TAC} is a partly heuristic tactic that can often
automatically prove elementary ``divisibility'' properties of the natural
numbers. The precise subset that is dealt with is difficult to describe
rigorously, but many universally quantified combinations of {divides},
{coprime}, {gcd} and congruences {(x == y) (mod n)} can be proved
automatically, as well as some existentially quantified goals. See the
documentation for {INTEGER_RULE} for a larger set of representative examples.

\FAILURE
Fails if the goal is not accessible to the methods used.

\EXAMPLE
A typical elementary divisibility property is that if two numbers are congruent 
with respect to two coprime (without non-trivial common factors) moduli, then 
they are congruent with respect to their product:
{
  # g `!m n x y:num. (x == y) (mod m) /\ (x == y) (mod n) /\ coprime(m,n) 
                     ==> (x == y) (mod (m * n))`;;
  ...
}
\noindent It can be solved automatically using {NUMBER_TAC}:
{
  # e NUMBER_TAC;;
  ...
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
}
The analogous goal without the coprimality assumption will fail, and indeed the 
goal would be false without it.
