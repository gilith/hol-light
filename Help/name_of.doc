\SYNOPSIS
Gets the name of a constant or variable.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term that is either a constant or a variable, {name_of}
returns its name (its true name, even if there is an interface mapping for it
in effect). When applied to any other term, it returns the empty string.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # name_of `x:int`;;
  val it : string = "x"

  # name_of `SUC`;;
  val it : string = "SUC"

  # name_of `x + 1`;;
  val it : string = ""

}
