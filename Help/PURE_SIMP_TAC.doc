\DOC PURE_SIMP_TAC

\TYPE {PURE_SIMP_TAC : thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplify a goal repeatedly by conditional contextual rewriting without default 
simplifications.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- g}, the tactic {PURE_SIMP_TAC thl} returns a new
goal {A ?- g'} where {g'} results from applying the theorems in {thl} as
(conditional) rewrite rules. The {PURE} prefix means that it does not apply the
built-in simplifications (see {basic_rewrites} and {basic_convs}). For more
details, see {SIMP_CONV}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, though may not change the goal if no simplifications are 
applicable.

\COMMENTS
To add the assumptions of the goal to the rewrites, use {PURE_ASM_SIMP_TAC} (or
just {ASM PURE_SIMP_TAC}).
