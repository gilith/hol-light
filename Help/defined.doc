\TYPE {defined : ('a, 'b) func -> 'a -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests if a finite partial function is defined on a certain domain value.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of a suite of operations on finite partial functions, type 
{('a,'b)func}. These may sometimes be preferable to ordinary functions since
they permit more operations such as equality comparison, extraction of domain
etc. The call {defined f x} returns {true} if the finite partial function {f} 
is defined on domain value {x}, and {false} otherwise.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # defined (1 |=> 2) 1;;
  val it : bool = true

  # defined (1 |=> 2) 2;;
  val it : bool = false

  # defined undefined 1;;
  val it : bool = false
}
