\DOC INT_LE_CONV

\TYPE {INT_LE_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Conversion to prove whether one integer literal of type {:int} is {<=}
another.

\DESCRIBE
The call {INT_LE_CONV `c1 <= c2`} where {c1} and {c2} are integer
litersls of type {:int}, returns whichever of {|- c1 <= c2 <=> T} or
{|- c1 <= c2 <=> F} is true. By an integer literal we mean either {&n} or
{-- &n} where {n} is a numeral.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not the appropriate inequality comparison on
two permitted integer literals of type {:int}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # INT_LE_CONV `&11 <= &77`;;
  val it : thm = |- &11 <= &77 <=> T
}
