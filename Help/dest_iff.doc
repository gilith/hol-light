\DOC dest_iff

\TYPE {dest_iff : term -> term * term}

\SYNOPSIS
Term destructor for logical equivalence.

\DESCRIBE
{dest_iff(`t1 <=> t2`)} returns {(`t1`,`t2`)}.

\FAILURE
Fails with if term is not a logical equivalence, i.e. an equation between terms 
of Boolean type.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # dest_iff `x = y <=> y = 1`;;           
  val it : term * term = (`x = y`, `y = 1`)
}

\COMMENTS
The function {dest_eq} has the same effect, but the present function checks 
that the types of the two sides are indeed Boolean, whereas {dest_eq} will 
break apart any equation.
