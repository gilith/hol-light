\DOC hide_constant

\TYPE {hide_constant : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Stops the quotation parser from recognizing a constant.

\DESCRIBE
A call {hide_constant "c"} where {c} is the name of a constant, will
prevent the quotation parser from parsing it as such; it will just be parsed as
a variable. The effect can be reversed by {unhide_constant "c"}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the given name is not a constant of the current theory, or if the
named constant is already hidden.

\COMMENTS
The hiding of a constant only affects the quotation parser; the constant is
still there in a theory, and may not be redefined.
