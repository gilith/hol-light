\TYPE {print_num : num -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Print an arbitrary-precision number to the terminal.

\DESCRIBE
This function prints an arbitrary-precision (type {num}) number to the 
terminal. It is automatically invoked on anything of type {num} at the toplevel 
anyway, but it may sometimes be useful to issue it under user control.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
