\TYPE {ideal_cofactors : (term -> num) * (num -> term) * conv * term * term * term * term * term * term * term * thm * (term -> thm) -> term list -> term -> term list}

\SYNOPSIS
Generic procedure to compute cofactors for ideal membership.

\DESCRIBE
The {ideal_cofactors} function takes first the same set of arguments as {RING},
defining a suitable ring for it to operate over. (See the entry for {RING} for
details.) It then yields a function that given a list of terms {[p1; ...; pn]}
and another term {p}, all of which have the right type to be considered as
polynomials over the ring, attempts to find a corresponding set of `cofactors'
{[q1; ...; qn]} such that the following is an algebraic ring identity:
{
  p = p1 * q1 + ... + pn * qn
}
That is, it provides a concrete certificate for the fact that {p} is in the
ideal generated by the {p1,...,pn}. If {p} is not in this ideal, the function
will fail.

\FAILURE
Fails if the `polynomials' are of the wrong type, or if ideal membership does
not hold.

\EXAMPLE
For an example of the real-number instantiation in action, see
