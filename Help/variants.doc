\TYPE {variants : term list -> term list -> term list}

\SYNOPSIS
Pick a list of variants of variables, avoiding a list of variables and each
other.

\DESCRIBE
The call {variants av vs},s where {av} and {vs} are both lists of variables,
will return a list {vs'} of variants of the variables in the list {vs}, renamed
as necessary by adding primes to avoid clashing with any free variables of the 
terms in the list {av} or with each other.

\FAILURE
Fails if any of the terms in the list is not a variable.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # variants [`x':num`; `x'':num`; `y:bool`] [`x:num`; `x':num`];;
  val it : term list = [`x`; `x'''`]
}
