\DOC SYM

\TYPE {SYM : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Swaps left-hand and right-hand sides of an equation.

\KEYWORDS
rule, symmetry, equality.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- t1 = t2}, the inference rule {SYM} returns
{A |- t2 = t1}.
{
    A |- t1 = t2
   --------------  SYM
    A |- t2 = t1
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is equational.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # NUM_REDUCE_CONV `12 * 12`;;
  val it : thm = |- 12 * 12 = 144

  # SYM it;;
  val it : thm = |- 144 = 12 * 12
}

\COMMENTS
The {SYM} rule requires the input theorem to be a simple equation, without 
additional structure such as outer universal quantifiers. To reverse equality 
signs deeper inside theorems, you may use {GSYM} instead.
