\DOC INT_RING

\TYPE {INT_RING : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Ring decision procedure instantiated to integers.

\DESCRIBE
The rule {INT_RING} should be applied to a formula that, after suitable
normalization, can be considered a universally quantified Boolean combination
of equations and inequations between terms of type {:int}. If that formula
holds in all integral domains, {INT_RING} will prove it. Any ``alien'' atomic
formulas that are not integer equations will not contribute to the proof but
will not in themselves cause an error. The function is a particular
instantiation of {RING}, which is a more generic procedure for ring and
semiring structures.

\FAILURE
Fails if the formula is unprovable by the methods employed. This does not
necessarily mean that it is not valid for {:int}, but rather that it is not
valid on all integral domains (see below).

\EXAMPLE
Here is a nice identity taken from one of Ramanujan's notebooks:
{
  # INT_RING 
     `!a b c:int.
       a + b + c = &0
       ==> &2 * (a * b + a * c + b * c) pow 2 = 
             a pow 4 + b pow 4 + c pow 4 /\
           &2 * (a * b + a * c + b * c) pow 4 =
             (a * (b - c)) pow 4 + (b * (a - c)) pow 4 + (c * (a - b)) pow 4`;;
  ...
  val it : thm =
    |- !a b c.
           a + b + c = &0
           ==> &2 * (a * b + a * c + b * c) pow 2 = a pow 4 + b pow 4 + c pow 4 /\
               &2 * (a * b + a * c + b * c) pow 4 =
               (a * (b - c)) pow 4 + (b * (a - c)) pow 4 + (c * (a - b)) pow 4
}
The reasoning {INT_RING} is capable of includes, of course, the degenerate case 
of simple algebraic identity, e.g. Brahmagupta's identity:
{
  # INT_RING `(a pow 2 + b pow 2) * (c pow 2 + d pow 2) =
              (a * c - b * d) pow 2 + (a * d + b * c) pow 2`;;
}
\noindent or the more complicated 4-squares variant:
{
  # INT_RING
    `(x1 pow 2 + x2 pow 2 + x3 pow 2 + x4 pow 2) *
     (y1 pow 2 + y2 pow 2 + y3 pow 2 + y4 pow 2) =
     (x1 * y1 - x2 * y2 - x3 * y3 - x4 * y4) pow 2 +
     (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1 + x3 * y4 - x4 * y3) pow 2 +
     (x1 * y3 - x2 * y4 + x3 * y1 + x4 * y2) pow 2 +
     (x1 * y4 + x2 * y3 - x3 * y2 + x4 * y1) pow 2`;;
  ...
}
Note that formulas depending on specific features of the integers are not
always provable by this generic ring procedure. For example we cannot prove:
{
  # INT_RING `x pow 2 = &2 ==> F`;;
  1 basis elements and 0 critical pairs
  Exception: Failure "find".
}
Although it is possible to deal with special cases like this, there can be no
general algorithm for testing such properties over the integers: the set of
true universally quantified equations over the integers with addition and
multiplication is not recursively enumerable. (This follows from Matiyasevich's
results on diophantine sets leading to the undecidability of Hilbert's 10th
problem.)
