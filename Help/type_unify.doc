\TYPE {type_unify : hol_type -> hol_type -> (hol_type * hol_type) list -> (hol_type * hol_type) list}

\SYNOPSIS
Unify two types by instantiating their type variables

\DESCRIBE
Given two types {ty1} and {ty2} and an existing instantiation {i} of type 
variables,  a call {type_unify vars ty1 ty2 i} attempts to find an augmented 
instantiation of the type variables to make the two types equal.

\FAILURE
Fails if the two types are not first-order unifiable by instantiating the given
type variables.
