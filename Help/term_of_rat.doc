\DOC term_of_rat

\TYPE {term_of_rat : num -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts OCaml number to canonical rational literal of type {:real}.

\DESCRIBE
The call {term_of_rat n}, where {n} is an OCaml rational number (type {num}),
returns the canonical rational literal of type {:real} that represents it. The
canonical literals are integer literals {&n} for numeral {n}, {-- &n} for a
nonzero numeral {n}, or ratios {&p / &q} or {-- &p / &q} where {p} is nonzero,
{q > 1} and {p} and {q} share no common factor.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # term_of_rat (Int 3 // Int 2);;
  val it : term = `&3 / &2`
}
