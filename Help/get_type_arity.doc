\TYPE {get_type_arity : string -> int}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the arity of a type constructor.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to the name of a type constructor, {arity} returns its arity, i.e. 
how many types it is supposed to be applied to. Base types like {:bool} are 
regarded as constructors with zero arity.
 
\FAILURE
Fails if there is no type constructor of that name.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # get_type_arity "bool";;
  val it : int = 0

  # get_type_arity "fun";;
  val it : int = 2

  # get_type_arity "nocon";;
  Exception: Failure "find".
}
