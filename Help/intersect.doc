\DOC intersect

\TYPE {intersect : 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes the intersection of two `sets'.

\KEYWORDS
list, set.

\DESCRIBE
{intersect l1 l2} returns a list consisting of those elements of {l1} that
also appear in {l2}. If both sets are free of repetitions, this can be 
considered a set-theoretic intersection operation.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
Duplicate elements in the first list will still be present in the result.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # intersect [1;2;3] [3;5;4;1];;
  val it : int list = [1; 3]
  # intersect [1;2;4;1] [1;2;3;2];;
  val it : int list = [1; 2; 1]
}
