\TYPE {mk_binop : term -> term -> term -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
The call {mk_binop op l r} returns the term {(op l) r}.

\KEYWORDS

\LIBRARY

\DESCRIBE
The call {mk_binop op l r} returns the term {(op l) r} provided that is 
well-typed. Otherwise it fails. The term {op} need not be a constant nor parsed 
as infix, but that is the usual case. Note that type variables in {op} are not 
instantiated, so it needs to be the correct instance for the terms {l} and {r}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the types are incompatible.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # mk_binop `(+):num->num->num` `1` `2`;;
  val it : term = `1 + 2`
}
