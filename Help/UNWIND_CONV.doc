\DOC UNWIND_CONV

\TYPE {UNWIND_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates existentially quantified variables that are equated to something.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {UNWIND_CONV}, applied to a formula with one or more existential
quantifiers, eliminates any existential quantifiers where the body contains a
conjunct equating its variable to some other term (with that variable not free
in it).

\FAILURE
{UNWIND_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not reducible according to that description.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # UNWIND_CONV `?a b c d. b = 7 /\ 2 = d /\ a + b + c + d = 97`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (?a b c d. b = 7 /\ 2 = d /\ a + b + c + d = 97) <=>
       (?a c. a + 7 + c + 2 = 97)

  # UNWIND_CONV `?w x y z. w = z /\ x = 1 /\ x + y = z /\ y = 42`;;
  val it : thm = |- (?w x y z. w = z /\ x = 1 /\ x + y = z /\ y = 42) <=> T

  # UNWIND_CONV `x = 2`;;
  Exception: Failure "CHANGED_CONV".
