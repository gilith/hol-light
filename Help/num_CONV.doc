\DOC num_CONV

\TYPE {num_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Provides definitional axiom for a nonzero numeral.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, number, arithmetic.

\DESCRIBE
{num_CONV} is an axiom-scheme from which one may obtain a defining equation for
any numeral not equal to {0} (i.e. {1}, {2}, {3},...).  If
{`n`} is such a constant, then {num_CONV `n`} returns the theorem:
{
   |- n = SUC m
}
\noindent where {m} is the numeral that denotes the predecessor of the
number denoted by {n}.

\FAILURE
{num_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is {`0`} or if not {tm} is not a numeral.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # num_CONV `3`;;
  val it : thm = |- 3 = SUC 2
}
