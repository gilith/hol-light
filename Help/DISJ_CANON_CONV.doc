\DOC DISJ_CANON_CONV

\TYPE {DISJ_CANON_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Puts an iterated disjunction in canonical form.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term, {DISJ_CANON_CONV} splits it into the set of disjuncts
and produces a theorem asserting the equivalence of the term and the new term
with the disjuncts right-associated without repetitions and in a canonical
order.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a non-Boolean term. If applied to a term that is not a
disjunction, it will trivially work in the sense of regarding it as a single
disjunct and returning a reflexive theorem.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # DISJ_CANON_CONV `(c \/ a \/ b) \/ (b \/ a \/ d)`;;
  val it : thm = |- (c \/ a \/ b) \/ b \/ a \/ d <=> a \/ b \/ c \/ d
}
