\DOC mk_fthm

\TYPE {mk_fthm : term list * term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Create arbitrary theorem by adding additional `false' assumption.

\DESCRIBE
The call {mk_fthm(asl,c)} returns a theorem with conclusion {c} and assumption
list {asl} together with the special assumption {_FALSITY_}, which is defined
to be logically equivalent to {F} (false). This is the closest approach to 
{mk_thm} that does not involve adding a new axiom and so potentially 
compromising soundness. 

\FAILURE
Fails if any of the given terms does not have Boolean type.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # mk_fthm([],`1 = 2`);;
  val it : thm = _FALSITY_ |- 1 = 2
}

\USES
Used for validity-checking of justification functions as a sanity check in 
tactic applications: see {VALID}.
