\DOC META_SPEC_TAC

\TYPE {META_SPEC_TAC : term -> thm -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Replaces universally quantified variable in theorem with metavariable.

\DESCRIBE
Given a variable {v} and a theorem {th} of the form {A |- !x. p[x]}, the
tactic {META_SPEC_TAC `v` th} is a tactic that adds the theorem {A |- p[v]} to
the assumptions of the goal, with {v} a new metavariable. This can later be
instantiated, e.g. by {UNIFY_ACCEPT_TAC}, and it is as if the instantiation
were done at this point.

\FAILURE
Fails if {v} is not a variable.

\EXAMPLE
See {UNIFY_ACCEPT_TAC} for an example of using metavariables.

\USES
Delaying instantiations until the right choice becomes clearer.

\COMMENTS
Users should probably steer clear of using metavariables if possible. Note that
the metavariable instantiations apply across the whole fringe of goals, not 
just the current goal, and can lead to confusion.
