\DOC load_path

\TYPE {load_path : string list ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Path where HOL Light tries to find files to load.

\DESCRIBE
The reference variable {load_path} gives a list of directories. When HOL loads
files with {loadt}, it will try these places in order on all non-absolute
filenames. An initial dollar sign {$} in each path is interpreted as a
reference to the current setting of {hol_dir}. To get an actual {$} at the
start of the filename, actually use two dollar signs {$$}.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.
