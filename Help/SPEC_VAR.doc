\DOC SPEC_VAR

\TYPE {SPEC_VAR : thm -> term * thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem, returning the chosen variant.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !x. t}, the inference rule {SPEC_VAR} returns
the term {x'} and the theorem {A |- t[x'/x]}, where {x'} is a variant
of {x} chosen to avoid clashing with free variables in assumptions.
{
     A |- !x. t
   --------------  SPEC_VAR
    A |- t[x'/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem's conclusion is universally quantified.

\EXAMPLE
Note how the variable is renamed to avoid the free {m} in the assumptions:
{
  #  let th = ADD_ASSUM `m = 1` ADD_SYM;;
  val th : thm = m = 1 |- !m n. m + n = n + m

  # SPEC_VAR th;;
  val it : term * thm = (`m'`, m = 1 |- !n. m' + n = n + m')
}
