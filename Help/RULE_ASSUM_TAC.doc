\DOC RULE_ASSUM_TAC

\TYPE {RULE_ASSUM_TAC : (thm -> thm) -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Maps an inference rule over the assumptions of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, assumption, rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to an inference rule {f} and a goal {({{A1;...;An}} ?- t)},
the {RULE_ASSUM_TAC} tactical applies the inference rule to each of the
assumptions to give a new goal.
{
             {{A1,...,An}} ?- t
   ====================================  RULE_ASSUM_TAC f
    {{f(.. |- A1),...,f(.. |- An)}} ?- t
}

\FAILURE
The application of {RULE_ASSUM_TAC f} to a goal fails iff {f} fails when
applied to any of the assumptions of the goal.

\COMMENTS
It does not matter if the goal has no assumptions, but in this case
{RULE_ASSUM_TAC} has no effect.
