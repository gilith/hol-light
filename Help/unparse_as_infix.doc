\DOC unparse_as_infix

\TYPE {unparse_as_infix : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Removes string from the list of infix operators.

\DESCRIBE
Certain identifiers are treated as infix operators with a given precedence and 
associativity (left or right). The call {unparse_as_infix "op"} removes {op} 
from the list of infix identifiers, if it was indeed there.

\FAILURE
Never fails, even if the given string did not originally have infix status.

\COMMENTS
Take care with applying this to some of the built-in operators, or parsing may 
fail in existing libraries.
