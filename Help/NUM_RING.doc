\DOC NUM_RING

\TYPE {NUM_RING : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Ring decision procedure instantiated to natural numbers.

\DESCRIBE
The rule {NUM_RING} should be applied to a formula that, after suitable 
normalization, can be considered a universally quantified Boolean combination 
of equations and inequations between terms of type {:num}. If that formula 
holds in all integral domains, {NUM_RING} will prove it. Any ``alien'' atomic
formulas that are not natural number equations will not contribute to the proof 
but will not in themselves cause an error. The function is a particular 
instantiation of {RING}, which is a more generic procedure for ring and 
semiring structures.

\FAILURE
Fails if the formula is unprovable by the methods employed. This does not 
necessarily mean that it is not valid for {:num}, but rather that it is not
valid on all integral domains (see below).

\EXAMPLE
The following formula is proved because it holds in all integral domains:
{
  # NUM_RING `(x + y) EXP 2 = x EXP 2 ==> y = 0 \/ y + 2 * x = 0`;;     
  1 basis elements and 0 critical pairs
  Translating certificate to HOL inferences
  val it : thm = |- (x + y) EXP 2 = x EXP 2 ==> y = 0 \/ y + 2 * x = 0
}
\noindent but the following isn't, even though over {:num} it is equivalent:
{
  # NUM_RING `(x + y) EXP 2 = x EXP 2 ==> y = 0 \/ x = 0`;;
  2 basis elements and 1 critical pairs
  3 basis elements and 2 critical pairs
  3 basis elements and 1 critical pairs
  4 basis elements and 1 critical pairs
  4 basis elements and 0 critical pairs
  Exception: Failure "find".
}

\COMMENTS
Note that since we are working over {:num}, which is not really a ring, cutoff
subtraction is not true ring subtraction and the ability of {NUM_RING} to
handle it is limited. Instantiations of {RING} to actual rings, such as
{REAL_RING}, have no such problems.
