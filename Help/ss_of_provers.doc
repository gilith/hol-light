\DOC ss_of_provers

\TYPE {ss_of_provers : prover list -> simpset -> simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Add new provers to a simpset.

\DESCRIBE
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked 
by {SIMP_TAC}) are controlled by a `simpset', which may contain conditional and 
unconditional rewrite rules, conversions and provers for conditions, as well as 
a determination of how to use the prover on the conditions and how to process 
theorems into rewrites. A call {ss_of_provers prs ss} adds the provers in {prs} 
to the simpset {ss} to yield a new simpset. See {mk_prover} for more 
explanation of how to create something of type {prover}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
