\TYPE {ABS_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Strips an abstraction from each side of an equational goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{ABS_TAC} reduces a goal of the form {A ?- (\x. s[x]) = (\y. t[y])}
by stripping away the abstractions to give a new goal {A ?- s[x'] = t[x']} 
where {x'} is a variant of {x}, the bound variable on the left-hand side, 
chosen not to be free in the current goal's assumptions or conclusion.
the function applications, giving the new goal {A ?- x = y}.
{
    A ?- (\x. s[x]) = (\y. t[y])
   ================================  ABS_TAC
        A ?- s[x'] = t[x']
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal is equational, with both sides being abstractions.
