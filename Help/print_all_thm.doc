\DOC print_all_thm

\TYPE {print_all_thm : bool ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Flag determining whether the assumptions of theorems are printed explicitly.

\DESCRIBE
The reference variable {print_all_thm} is one of several
settable parameters controlling printing of terms by {pp_print_term}, and hence
the automatic printing of terms and theorems at the toplevel.
When it is {true}, as it is by default, all assumptions of theorems are
printed. When it is {false}, they are abbreviated by dots.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # let th = ADD_ASSUM `1 + 1 = 2` (ASSUME `2 + 2 = 4`);;
  val th : thm = 2 + 2 = 4, 1 + 1 = 2 |- 2 + 2 = 4
  # print_all_thm := false;;
  val it : unit = ()
  # th;;
  val it : thm = ... |- 2 + 2 = 4
}
