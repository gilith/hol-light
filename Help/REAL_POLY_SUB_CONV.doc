\DOC REAL_POLY_SUB_CONV

\TYPE {REAL_POLY_SUB_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Subtracts two real polynomials while retaining canonical form.

\DESCRIBE
For many purposes it is useful to retain polynomials in a canonical form. For
more information on the usual normal form in HOL Light, see the function
{REAL_POLY_CONV}, which converts a polynomial to normal form while proving the
equivalence of the original and normalized forms. The function
{REAL_POLY_SUB_CONV} is a more delicate conversion that, given a term {p1 - p2}
where {p1} and {p2} are real polynomials in normal form, returns a theorem 
{|- p1 - p2 = p} where {p} is in normal form.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not the difference of two real terms. If
these subterms are not polynomials in normal form, the overall normalization is
not guaranteed.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # REAL_POLY_SUB_CONV `(x pow 2 + x) - (x pow 2 + -- &1 * x + &1)`;;
  val it : thm = |- (x pow 2 + x) - (x pow 2 + -- &1 * x + &1) = &2 * x + -- &1
}

\USES
More delicate polynomial operations that simply the direct normalization with 
{REAL_POLY_CONV}.
