\DOC CHANGED_TAC

\TYPE {CHANGED_TAC : tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes a tactic fail if it has no effect.

\KEYWORDS
tactical.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a tactic {t}, the tactical {CHANGED_TAC} gives a new tactic
which is the same as {t} if that has any effect, and otherwise fails.

\FAILURE
The application of {CHANGED_TAC} to a tactic never fails. The resulting
tactic fails if the basic tactic either fails or has no effect.

\USES
Occasionally useful in controlling complicated tctic compositions. Also 
sometimes convenient just to check that a step did indeed modify a goal.

\SEEALSO
TRY, VALID.
