\DOC set_eq

\TYPE {set_eq : 'a list -> 'a list -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests two `sets' for equality.

\DESCRIBE
{set_eq l1 l2} returns {true} if every element of {l1} appears in {l2} and
every element of {l2} appears in {l1}. Otherwise it returns {false}. In other 
words, it tests if the lists are the same considered as sets, i.e. ignoring 
duplicates.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # set_eq [1;2] [2;1;2];;
  val it : bool = true
  # set_eq [1;2] [1;3];;
  val it : bool = false
}
