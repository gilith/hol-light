\DOC NUM_CANCEL_CONV

\TYPE {NUM_CANCEL_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Cancels identical terms from both sides of natural number equation.

\DESCRIBE
Given an equational term {`t1 + ... + tn = s1 + ... + sm`} (with arbitrary 
association of the additions) where both sides have natural number type, the
conversion identifies common elements among the {ti} and {si}, and cancels them
from both sides, returning a theorem: 
{
  |- t1 + ... + tn = s1 + ... + sm <=> u1 + ... + uk = v1 + ... + vl
}
\noindent where the {ui} and {vi} are the remaining elements of the {ti} and 
{si} respectively, in some order.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not an equation between natural number 
terms.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # NUM_CANCEL_CONV `(a + b + x * y + SUC c) + d = SUC c + d + y * z`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- (a + b + x * y + SUC c) + d = SUC c + d + y * z <=>
       x * y + b + a = y * z
}

\USES
Simplifying equations where explicitly directing the cancellation would be 
tedious. However, this is mostly intended for ``bootstrapping'', before more 
powerful rules like {ARITH_RULE} and {NUM_RING} are available.
