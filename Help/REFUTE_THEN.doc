\TYPE {REFUTE_THEN : thm_tactic -> goal -> goalstate}

\SYNOPSIS
Assume the negation of the goal and apply theorem-tactic to it.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic {REFUTE_THEN ttac} applied to a goal {g}, assumes the negation of
the goal and applies {ttac} to it and a similar goal with a conclusion of {F}. 
More precisely, if the original goal {A ?- u} is unnegated and {ttac}'s action 
is
{
    A ?- F
   ========  ttac (ASSUME `~u`)
    B ?- v
}
\noindent then we have
{
     A ?- u
   ==============  REFUTE_THEN ttac
     B ?- v
}
For example, if {ttac} is just {ASSUME_TAC}, this corresponds to a classic 
`proof by contradiction':
{                                  
         A ?- u                        
   =================  REFUTE_THEN ASSUME_TAC
    A u {{~u}} ?- F                                   
}                                                
Whatever {ttac} may be, if the conclusion {u} of the goal is negated, the
effect is the same except that the assumed theorem will not be double-negated,
so the effect is the same as {DISCH_THEN}. 

\FAILURE
Never fails unless the underlying theorem-tactic {ttac} does.

\USES
Classical `proof by contradiction'.

\COMMENTS
When applied to an unnegated goal, this tactic embodies implicitly the 
classical principle of `proof by contradiction', but for negated goals the 
tactic is also intuitionistically valid.
