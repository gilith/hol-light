\TYPE {is_reserved_word : string -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests if a string is one of the reserved words.

\DESCRIBE
Certain identifiers in HOL are reserved, e.g. `{if}', `{let}' and `{|}', 
meaning that they are special to the parser and cannot be used as ordinary 
identifiers. The call {is_reserved_word s} tests if the string {s} is one of 
them.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\SEEALSO
reserved_words, reserve_words, unreserve_words.
