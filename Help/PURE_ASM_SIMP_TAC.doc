\DOC PURE_ASM_SIMP_TAC

\TYPE {PURE_ASM_SIMP_TAC : thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Perform simplification of goal by conditional contextual rewriting using
assumptions.

\DESCRIBE
A call to {PURE_ASM_SIMP_TAC[theorems]} will apply conditional contextual
rewriting with {theorems} and the current assumptions of the goal to the goal's
conclusion, but not the default simplfiications (see {basic_rewrites} and
{basic_convs}). For more details on this kind of rewriting, see {SIMP_CONV}. If
the extra generality of contextual conditional rewriting is not needed,
{REWRITE_TAC} is usually more efficient.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but may loop indefinitely.
