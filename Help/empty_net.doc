\TYPE {empty_net : 'a net}

\SYNOPSIS
Empty term net.

\DESCRIBE
Term nets (type {'a net}) are a lookup structure associating objects of type
{'a}, e.g. conversions, with a corresponding `pattern' term. For a given term,
one can then relatively quickly look up all objects whose pattern terms might
possibly match to it. This is used, for example, in rewriting to quickly filter
out obviously inapplicable rewrites rather than attempting each one in turn.
The (polymorphic) object {empty_net} is the term net with no objects defined;
it can then be augmented by {enter} or {merge_nets} and used in {lookup}.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\SEEALSO
enter, lookup, merge_nets.
