\TYPE {basic_ss : thm list -> simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Construct a straightforward simpset from a list of theorems.

\DESCRIBE
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked
by {SIMP_TAC}) are controlled by a `simpset'. A call {basic_ss thl} gives a
straightforward simpset used by the default simplifier instances like
{SIMP_TAC}, which has the given theorems as well as the basic rewrites and
conversions, and no other provers.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
