\DOC define_type_raw

\TYPE {define_type_raw : (hol_type * (string * hol_type list) list) list -> thm * thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Like {define_type} but from a more structured representation than a string.

\DESCRIBE
The core functionality of {define_type_raw} is the same as {define_type}, but
the input is a more structured format for the type specification. In fact,
{define_type} is just the composition of {define_type_raw} and
{parse_inductive_type_specification}.

\FAILURE
May fail for the usual reasons {define_type} may.

\USES
Not intended for general use, but sometimes useful in proof tools that want to
generate inductive types.

\SEEALSO
define_type, parse_inductive_type_specification.
