\TYPE {PURE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC : thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a goal including the goal's assumptions as rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{PURE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC} generates a set of rewrites from the supplied
theorems and the assumptions of the goal, and applies these in a
top-down recursive manner until no match is found. See
{GEN_REWRITE_TAC} for more information on the group of rewriting
tactics.

\FAILURE
{PURE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC} does not fail, but it can diverge in certain
situations. For limited depth rewriting, see
{PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC}. It can also result in an invalid tactic.

\USES
To advance or solve a goal when the current assumptions are expected
to be useful in reducing the goal.
