\DOC NOT_INTRO

\TYPE {NOT_INTRO : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Transforms {|- t ==> F} into {|- ~t}.

\KEYWORDS
rule, negation, implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- t ==> F}, the inference rule {NOT_INTRO}
returns the theorem {A |- ~t}.
{
    A |- t ==> F
   --------------  NOT_INTRO
      A |- ~t
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem has an implicative conclusion with {F}
as the consequent.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # let th = TAUT `F ==> F`;;
  val th : thm = |- F ==> F

  # NOT_INTRO th;;
  val it : thm = |- ~F
}
