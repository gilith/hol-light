\DOC axioms

\TYPE {axioms : unit -> thm list}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the current set of axioms.

\DESCRIBE
A call {axioms()} returns the current list of axioms.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
Under normal circumstances, the list of axioms will be as follows, containing
the axioms of infinity, choice and extensionality.
{
  # axioms();;
  val it : thm list =
    [|- ?f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f; |- !P x. P x ==> P ((@) P);
     |- !t. (\x. t x) = t]
}
If other axioms are used, the consistency of the resulting theory cannot be
guaranteed. However, new definitions and type definitions are always safe and
are not considered as true `axioms'.
