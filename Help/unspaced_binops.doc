\DOC unspaced_binops

\TYPE {unspaced_binops : string list ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Determines which binary operators are printed with surrounding spaces.

\DESCRIBE
The reference variable {unspaced_binops} is one of several settable parameters
controlling printing of terms by {pp_print_term}, and hence the automatic
printing of terms and theorems at the toplevel. It holds a list of the names of
infix binary operators that are printed without surrounding spaces. By default,
it contains just the pairing operation `{,}', the numeric range `{..}' and the 
cartesian power indexing `{$}'.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # `x + 1`;;
  val it : term = `x + 1`

  # unspaced_binops := "+"::(!unspaced_binops);;
  val it : unit = ()
  # `x + 1`;;
  val it : term = `x+1`
}
