\TYPE {g : term -> goalstack}

\SYNOPSIS
Initializes the subgoal package with a new goal which has no assumptions.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
   g `tm`
}
\noindent is equivalent to
{
   set_goal([],`tm`)
}
\noindent and clearly more convenient if a goal has no assumptions.
For a description of the subgoal package, see  {set_goal}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the argument term has type {bool}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # g `HD[1;2;3] = 1 /\ TL[1;2;3] = [2;3]`;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)
  
  `HD [1; 2; 3] = 1 /\ TL [1; 2; 3] = [2; 3]`
}
