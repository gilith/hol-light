\DOC basic_net

\TYPE {basic_net : unit -> gconv net}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the term net used to optimize access to default rewrites and 
conversions.

\DESCRIBE
The HOL Light rewriter ({REWRITE_TAC} etc.) and simplifier ({SIMP_TAC} etc.) 
have default sets of (conditional) equations and other conversions that are 
applied by default, except in the {PURE_} variants. Internally, these are 
maintained in a term net (see {enter} and {lookup} for more information), and a 
call to {basic_net()} returns that net.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
Only useful for those who are delving deep into the implementation of 
rewriting.

\SEEALSO
basic_convs, basic_rewrites, enter, lookup.
