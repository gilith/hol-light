\TYPE {NO_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Tactic that always fails.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
Whatever goal it is applied to, {NO_TAC} always fails with {Failure "NO_TAC"}.

\FAILURE
Always fails.

\EXAMPLE
However trivial the goal, {NO_TAC} always fails:
{
  # g `T`;;
  val it : goalstack = 1 subgoal (1 total)
  
  `T`
  
  # e NO_TAC;;
  Exception: Failure "NO_TAC".
}
\noindent however, {tac THEN NO_TAC} will never reach {NO_TAC} if {tac} leaves 
no subgoals:
{
  # e(REWRITE_TAC[] THEN NO_TAC);;
  val it : goalstack = No subgoals
}

\USES
Can be useful in forcing certain ``speculative'' tactics to fail unless they 
solve the goal completely. For example, you might wish to break down a huge 
conjunction of goals and attempt to solve as many conjuncts as possible by 
just rewriting with a list of theorems {[thl]}. You could do:
{
  REPEAT CONJ_TAC THEN REWRITE_TAC[thl]
}
\noindent However, if you don't want to apply the rewrites unless they result 
in an immediate solution, you can do instead:
{
  REPEAT CONJ_TAC THEN TRY(REWRITE_TAC[thl] THEN NO_TAC)
}
