\TYPE {ASM_MESON_TAC : thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Automated first-order proof search tactic using assumptions of goal.

\DESCRIBE
A call to {ASM_MESON_TAC[theorems]} will attempt to establish the goal using
pure first-order reasining, taking {theorems} and the assumptions of the goal
as the starting-point. It will usually either solve the goal completely or run
for an infeasible length of time before terminating, but it may sometimes fail
quickly. For more details, see {MESON} or {MESON_TAC}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the goal is unprovable within the search bounds, though not
necessarily in a feasible amount of time.
