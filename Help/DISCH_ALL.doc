\DOC DISCH_ALL

\TYPE {DISCH_ALL : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Discharges all hypotheses of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, discharge, assumption, implication.

\DESCRIBE
{
         A1, ..., An |- t
   ----------------------------  DISCH_ALL
    |- A1 ==> ... ==> An ==> t
}

\FAILURE
{DISCH_ALL} will not fail if there are no hypotheses to discharge, it will
simply return the theorem unchanged.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # end_itlist CONJ (map ASSUME [`p:bool`; `q:bool`; `r:bool`]);;
  val it : thm = p, q, r |- p /\ q /\ r

  # DISCH_ALL it;;
  val it : thm = |- r ==> q ==> p ==> p /\ q /\ r
}

\COMMENTS
Users should not rely on the hypotheses being discharged in any particular
order.  Two or more alpha-convertible hypotheses will be discharged by a
single implication; users should not rely on which hypothesis appears in the
implication.
