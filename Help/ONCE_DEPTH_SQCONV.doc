\DOC ONCE_DEPTH_SQCONV

\TYPE {ONCE_DEPTH_SQCONV : strategy}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies simplification to the first suitable sub-term(s) encountered in
top-down order.

\DESCRIBE
HOL Light's simplification functions (e.g. {SIMP_TAC}) have their traversal 
algorithm controlled by a ``strategy''. {ONCE_DEPTH_SQCONV} is a strategy 
corresponding to {ONCE_DEPTH_CONV} for ordinary conversions: simplification is 
applied to the first suitable subterm(s) encountered in top-down order.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\SEEALSO

TOP_SWEEP_SQCONV.
