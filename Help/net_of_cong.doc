\DOC net_of_cong

\TYPE {net_of_cong : thm -> (int * (term -> thm)) net -> (int * (term -> thm)) net}

\SYNOPSIS
Add a congruence rule to a net.

\DESCRIBE
The underlying machinery in rewriting and simplification assembles
(conditional) rewrite rules and other conversions into a net, including a
priority number so that, for example, pure rewrites get applied before
conditional rewrites. The congruence rules used by the simplifier to establish 
context (see {extend_basic_congs}) are also stored in this structure, with the 
lowest priority 4. A call {net_of_cong th net} adds {th} as a new congruence 
rule to {net} to yield an updated net.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the congruence is of the appropriate implicational form.
