\DOC SIMP_TAC

\TYPE {SIMP_TAC : thm list -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplify a goal repeatedly by conditional contextual rewriting.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- g}, the tactic {SIMP_TAC thl} returns a new
goal {A ?- g'} where {g'} results from applying the theorems in {thl} as
(conditional) rewrite rules, as well as built-in simplifications (see
{basic_rewrites} and {basic_convs}). For more details, see {SIMP_CONV}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, though may not change the goal if no simplifications are
applicable.

\COMMENTS
To add the assumptions of the goal to the rewrites, use {ASM_SIMP_TAC} (or just
{ASM SIMP_TAC}).
