\DOC find_terms

\TYPE {find_terms : (term -> bool) -> term -> term list}

\SYNOPSIS
Searches a term for all subterms that satisfy a predicate.

\DESCRIBE
A list of subterms of a given term that satisfy the predicate is returned.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
This is a simple example:
{
  # find_terms is_var `x + y + z`;;
  val it : term list = [`z`; `y`; `x`]
}
\noindent while the following shows that the terms returned may overlap or
contain each other: 
{
  # find_terms is_comb `x + y + z`;;
  val it : term list = [`(+) y`; `y + z`; `(+) x`; `x + y + z`]
}
