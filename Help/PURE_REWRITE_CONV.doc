\DOC PURE_REWRITE_CONV

\TYPE {PURE_REWRITE_CONV : thm list -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a term with only the given list of rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
This conversion provides a method for rewriting a term with the theorems given,
and excluding simplification with tautologies in {basic_rewrites}. Matching
subterms are found recursively, until no more matches are found.
For more details on rewriting see
{GEN_REWRITE_CONV}.

\USES
{PURE_REWRITE_CONV} is useful when the simplifications that arise by
rewriting a theorem with {basic_rewrites} are not wanted.

\FAILURE
Does not fail. May result in divergence, in which case
{PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_CONV} can be used.
