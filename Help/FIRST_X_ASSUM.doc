\DOC FIRST_X_ASSUM

\TYPE {FIRST_X_ASSUM : thm_tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies theorem-tactic to first assumption possible, extracting assumption.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical, assumption.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic
{
   FIRST_X_ASSUM ttac ([A1; ...; An], g)
}
\noindent has the effect of applying the first tactic which can be produced by
{ttac} from the assumptions {(.. |- A1)}, ..., {(.. |- An)} and which
succeeds when applied to the goal with that assumption removed. Failures of
{ttac} to produce a tactic are ignored. The similar function {FIRST_ASSUM} is
the same except that the assumption used is not removed from the goal.

\FAILURE
Fails if {ttac (.. |- Ai)} fails for every assumption {Ai}, or if the
assumption list is empty, or if all the tactics produced by {ttac} fail when
applied to the goal.

\EXAMPLE
The tactic
{
   FIRST_X_ASSUM MATCH_MP_TAC
}
\noindent searches the assumption list for an implication whose conclusion
matches the goal, removing that assumption and reducing the goal to the
antecedent of the corresponding instance of this implication.
