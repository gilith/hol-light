\TYPE {dom : ('a, 'b) func -> 'a list}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns domain of a finite partial function.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of a suite of operations on finite partial functions, type 
{('a,'b)func}. These may sometimes be preferable to ordinary functions since
they permit more operations such as equality comparison, extraction of domain
etc. The {dom} operation returns the domain of such a function, i.e. the set of 
points on which it is defined.

\FAILURE
Attempts to sort the resulting list, so may fail if the domain type does
not admit comparisons.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # dom (1 |=> "1");;              
  val it : int list = [1]
  # dom(itlist I [2|->4; 3|->6] undefined);;
  val it : int list = [2; 3]
}
