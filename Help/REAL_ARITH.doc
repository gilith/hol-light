\TYPE {REAL_ARITH : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempt to prove term using basic algebra and linear arithmetic over the reals.

\DESCRIBE
{REAL_ARITH} is the basic tool for proving elementary lemmas about real
equations and inequalities. Given a term, it first applies various
normalizations, eliminating constructs such as {max}, {min} and {abs} by
introducing case splits, splitting over the arms of conditionals and putting
any equations and inequalities into a form {p(x) <><> 0} where {<><>} is an
equality or inequality function and {p(x)} is in a normal form for polynomials
as produced by {REAL_POLY_CONV}. The problem is split into the refutation of
various conjunctions of such subformulas. A refutation of each is attempted
using simple linear inequality reasoning (essentially Fourier-Motzkin
elimination). Note that no non-trivial nonlinear inequality reasoning is
performed (see below).

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not provable using the algorithm sketched above.

\EXAMPLE
Here is some simple inequality reasoning, showing how constructs like {abs},
{max} and {min} can be handled:
{
  # REAL_ARITH
      `abs(x) < min e d / &2 /\ abs(y) < min e d / &2 ==> abs(x + y) < d + e`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- abs x < min e d / &2 /\ abs y < min e d / &2 ==> abs (x + y) < d + e
}
The following example also involves inequality reasoning, but the initial
algebraic normalization is critical to make the pieces match up:
{
  # REAL_ARITH `(&1 + x) * (&1 - x) * (&1 + x pow 2) < &1 ==> &0 < x pow 4`;;
  val it : thm = |- (&1 + x) * (&1 - x) * (&1 + x pow 2) < &1 ==> &0 < x pow 4
}

\USES
Very convenient for providing elementary lemmas that would otherwise be painful
to prove manually.

\COMMENTS
For nonlinear equational reasoning, use {REAL_RING} or {REAL_FIELD}. For
nonlinear inequality reasoning, there are no powerful rules built into HOL
Light, but the additional derived rules defined in {Examples/sos.ml} and
{Rqe/make.ml} may be useful.
