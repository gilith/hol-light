\DOC AUGMENT_SIMPSET

\TYPE {AUGMENT_SIMPSET : thm -> simpset -> simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Augment context of a simpset with a list of theorems.

\DESCRIBE
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked 
by {SIMP_TAC}) are controlled by a `simpset'. Given a list of theorems {thl} 
and a simpset {ss}, the call {AUGMENT_SIMPSET thl ss} augments the state of the 
simpset, adding the theorems as new rewrite rules and also making any
provers in the simpset process the new context appropriately.

\FAILURE
Never fails unless some of the simpset functions are ill-formed.

\USES
Mostly for experts wishing to customize the simplifier.
