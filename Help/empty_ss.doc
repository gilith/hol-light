\TYPE {empty_ss : simpset}

\SYNOPSIS
Simpset consisting of only the default rewrites and conversions.

\DESCRIBE
In their maximal generality, simplification operations in HOL Light (as invoked 
by {SIMP_TAC}) are controlled by a `simpset'. The simpset {empty_ss} has just 
the basic rewrites and conversions (see {basic_rewrites} and {basic_convs}), 
and no other provers.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.
