\DOC extend_basic_rewrites

\TYPE {extend_basic_rewrites : thm list -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Extend the set of default rewrites used by rewriting and simplification.

\DESCRIBE
The HOL Light rewriter ({REWRITE_TAC} etc.) and simplifier ({SIMP_TAC} etc.)
have default sets of (conditional) equations and other conversions that are
applied by default, except in the {PURE_} variants. A call to
{extend_basic_rewrites thl} extends the former with the list of theorems {thl},
so they will thereafter happen by default.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\SEEALSO
basic_rewrites, extend_basic_convs, set_basic_rewrites.
