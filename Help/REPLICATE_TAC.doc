\DOC REPLICATE_TAC

\TYPE {REPLICATE_TAC : int -> tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Apply a tactic a specific number of times.

\DESCRIBE
The call {REPLICATE n tac} gives a new tactic that it equivalent to an {n}-fold 
repetition of {tac}, i.e. {tac THEN tac THEN ... THEN tac}.
  
\FAILURE
The call {REPLICATE n tac} never fails, but when applied to a goal it will fail 
if the tactic does.

\EXAMPLE
We might conceivably want to strip off exactly three universal quantifiers from 
a goal that contains more than three. We can use {REPLICATE_TAC 3 GEN_TAC} to 
do that.
