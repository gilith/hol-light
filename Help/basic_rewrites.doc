\DOC basic_rewrites

\TYPE {basic_rewrites : unit -> thm list}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the set of built-in theorems used, by default, in rewriting.

\DESCRIBE
The list of theorems returned by {basic_rewrites()} is applied by default in 
rewriting conversions, rules and tactics such as {ONCE_REWRITE_CONV}, 
{REWRITE_RULE} and {SIMP_TAC}, though not in the `pure' variants like
{PURE_REWRITE_TAC}. This default set can be modified using
{extend_basic_rewrites}, {set_basic_rewrites}. Other conversions, not
necessarily expressible as rewriting with a theorem, can be added using 
{set_basic_convs} and {extend_basic_convs} and examined by {basic_convs}.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows the list of default rewrites in the standard HOL Light 
state. Most of them are basic logical tautologies.
{
# basic_rewrites();;
val it : thm list =
  [|- FST (x,y) = x; |- SND (x,y) = y; |- FST x,SND x = x;
   |- (if x = x then y else z) = y; |- (if T then t1 else t2) = t1;
   |- (if F then t1 else t2) = t2; |- ~ ~t <=> t; |- ~T <=> F; |- ~F <=> T;
   |- (@y. y = x) = x; |- x = x <=> T; |- (T <=> t) <=> t;
   |- (t <=> T) <=> t; |- (F <=> t) <=> ~t; |- (t <=> F) <=> ~t; |- ~T <=> F;
   |- ~F <=> T; |- T /\ t <=> t; |- t /\ T <=> t; |- F /\ t <=> F;
   |- t /\ F <=> F; |- t /\ t <=> t; |- T \/ t <=> T; |- t \/ T <=> T;
   |- F \/ t <=> t; |- t \/ F <=> t; |- t \/ t <=> t; |- T ==> t <=> t;
   |- t ==> T <=> T; |- F ==> t <=> T; |- t ==> t <=> T; |- t ==> F <=> ~t;
   |- (!x. t) <=> t; |- (?x. t) <=> t; |- (\x. f x) y = f y;
   |- x = x ==> p <=> p]
}

\USES
The {basic_rewrites} are included in the set of equations used by some
of the rewriting tools.
