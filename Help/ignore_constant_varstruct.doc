\DOC ignore_constant_varstruct

\TYPE {ignore_constant_varstruct : bool ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Interpret a simple varstruct as a variable, even if there is a constant of that 
name.

\DESCRIBE
As well as conventional abstractions {`\x. t`} where {x} is a variable, HOL 
Light permits generalized abstractions where the varstruct is a more complex 
term, e.g. {`\(x,y). x + y`}. This includes the degenerate case of just a 
constant. However, one may want a regular abstraction whose bound variable 
happens to be in use as a constant. When parsing a quotation {"\c. t"} where 
{c} is the name of a constant, HOL Light interprets it as a simple abstraction 
with a variable {c} when the flag {ignore_constant_varstruct} is {true}, as it 
is by default. It will interpret it as a degenerate generalized abstraction,
only useful when applied to the constant {c}, if the flag is {false}.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.
