\TYPE {equals_thm : thm -> thm -> bool}

\SYNOPSIS
Equality test on theorems.

\DESCRIBE
The call {equals_thm th1 th2} returns {true} if and only if both the 
conclusions and assumptions of the two theorems {th1} and {th2} are exactly the 
same. The same can be achieved by a simple equality test, but it is better 
practice to use this function because it will also work in the proof recording  
version of HOL Light (see the {Proofrecording} subdirectory).

\FAILURE
Never fails.
