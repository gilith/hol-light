\DOC SELECT_RULE

\TYPE {SELECT_RULE : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces an epsilon term in place of an existential quantifier.

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon.

\DESCRIBE
The inference rule {SELECT_RULE} expects a theorem asserting the
existence of a value {x} such that {P} holds.  The equivalent assertion
that the epsilon term {@x.P} denotes a value of {x} for
which {P} holds is returned as a theorem.
{
       A |- ?x. P
   ------------------  SELECT_RULE
    A |- P[(@x.P)/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a theorem the conclusion of which is not
existentially quantified.

\EXAMPLE
The axiom {INFINITY_AX} in the theory {ind} is of the form:
{
   |- ?f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f
}
\noindent Applying {SELECT_RULE} to this theorem returns the following.
{
  # SELECT_RULE INFINITY_AX;;
  val it : thm =
    |- ONE_ONE (@f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f) /\ ~ONTO (@f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f)
}
\USES
May be used to introduce an epsilon term to permit rewriting with a
constant defined using the epsilon operator.
