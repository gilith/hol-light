\DOC list_mk_exists

\TYPE {list_mk_exists : term list * term -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Multiply existentially quantifies both sides of an equation using the given
variables.

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, existential.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of terms {[x1;...;xn]}, where the {ti} are all
variables, and a theorem {A |- t1 = t2}, the inference rule
{LIST_MK_EXISTS} existentially quantifies both sides of the equation
using the variables given, none of which should be free in the assumption
list.
{
              A |- t1 <=> t2
   ----------------------------------------  LIST_MK_EXISTS [`x1`;...;`xn`]
    A |- (?x1...xn. t1) <=> (?x1...xn. t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if any term in the list is not a variable or is free in the assumption
list, or if the theorem is not equational.
