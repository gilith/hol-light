\DOC mk_char

\TYPE {mk_char : char -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructs object-level character from OCaml character.

\DESCRIBE
{mk_char 'c'} produces the HOL term of type {char} corresponding to the OCaml 
character {c}.

\FAILURE
Never fails

\EXAMPLE
{
  # mk_char 'c';;
  val it : term = `ASCII F T T F F F T T`
}

\COMMENTS
There is no particularly convenient parser/printer support for the HOL {char} 
type, but when combined into lists they are considered as strings and provided 
with more intuitive parser/printer support.
