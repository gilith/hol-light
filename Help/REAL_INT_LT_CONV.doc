\DOC REAL_INT_LT_CONV

\TYPE {REAL_INT_LT_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Conversion to prove whether one integer literal of type {:real} is {<}
another.

\DESCRIBE
The call {REAL_INT_LT_CONV `c1 < c2`} where {c1} and {c2} are integer
litersls of type {:real}, returns whichever of {|- c1 < c2 <=> T} or
{|- c1 < c2 <=> F} is true. By an integer literal we mean either {&n} or
{-- &n} where {n} is a numeral.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not the appropriate inequality comparison on
two permitted integer literals of type {:real}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # REAL_INT_LT_CONV `-- &18 < &64`;;
  val it : thm = |- -- &18 < &64 <=> T
}

\COMMENTS
The related function {REAL_RAT_LT_CONV} subsumes this functionality, also
applying to rational literals. Unless the restriction to integers is desired or
a tiny efficiency difference matters, it should be used in preference.
