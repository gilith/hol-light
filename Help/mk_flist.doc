\DOC mk_flist

\TYPE {mk_flist : term list -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructs object-level list from nonempty list of terms.

\DESCRIBE
{mk_flist [`t1`;...;`tn`]} returns {`[t1;...;tn]`}. The list must be nonempty, 
since the type could not be inferred for that case. For cases where you may 
need to construct an empty list, use {mk_list}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the list is empty or if the types of any elements differ from each
other.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # mk_flist(map mk_small_numeral (1--10));;    
  val it : term = `[1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]`
}
