\DOC CNF_CONV

\TYPE {CNF_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a term already in negation normal form into conjunctive normal form.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term already in negation normal form (see {NNF_CONV}), 
meaning that all other propositional connectives have been eliminated in favour 
of conjunction, disjunction and negation, and negation is only applied to 
atomic formulas, {CNF_CONV} puts the term into an equivalent conjunctive normal 
form, which is a right-associated conjunction of disjunctions without 
repetitions. No reduction by subsumption is performed, however, e.g. from 
{a /\ (a \/ b)} to just {a}).
 
\FAILURE
Never fails; non-Boolean terms will just yield a reflexive theorem.

\EXAMPLE
{
  # CNF_CONV `(a /\ b) \/ (a /\ b /\ c) \/ d`;;
  val it : thm =
    |- a /\ b \/ a /\ b /\ c \/ d <=>
       (a \/ d) /\ (a \/ b \/ d) /\ (a \/ c \/ d) /\ (b \/ d) /\ (b \/ c \/ d)
}
