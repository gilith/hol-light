\TYPE {meson_skew : int ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Determines skew in {MESON} proof tree search limits.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of several parameters determining the behavior of {MESON},
{MESON_TAC} and related rules and tactics. During search, {MESON} successively 
searches for proofs of larger and larger `size'. The ``skew'' value determines 
what proportion of the entire proof size is permitted in the left-hand half of 
the list of subgoals. The symmetrical value is {2} (meaning one half), the
default setting of {3} (one third) seems generally better because it can cut 
down on redundancy in proofs.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.

\USES
For users requiring fine control over the algorithms used in {MESON}'s 
first-order proof search.

\COMMENTS
For more details of {MESON}'s search strategy, see Harrison's paper
``Optimizing Proof Search in Model Elimination'', CADE-13, 1996.
