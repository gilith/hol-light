\DOC meson_chatty

\TYPE {meson_chatty : bool ref}

\SYNOPSIS
Make {MESON}'s output more verbose and detailed.

\DESCRIBE
This is one of several parameters determining the behavior of {MESON},
{MESON_TAC} and related rules and tactics. When {meson_chatty} is set to
{true}, {MESON} provides more verbose output, reporting at each level of
iterative deepening search the current size limit and number of inferences on a
fresh line. When {meson_chatty} is {false}, as it is by default, the core
inference numbers are condensed into 1-line output.

\FAILURE
Not applicable.
