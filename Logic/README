                FORMALIZED METATHEORY OF FIRST-ORDER LOGIC

                       (c) John Harrison 1998-2008

This is a miscellany of results involving formalization of first-order
logic and various proof systems, particularly automated theorem proving
methods like resolution. It's a combination of work published here:

    Formalizing Basic First Order Model Theory
    Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Theorem Proving
    in Higher Order Logics, TPHOLs'98, Springer LNCS 1497, pp. 153-170.

and later work done as a correctness check when writing my textbook on
automated reasoning:

    "Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning"
    Cambridge University Press 2009

    https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp/index.html

There is additional formalization work connected with the material
there on limitations (Tarski, Goedel etc.). That can be found in the
"Arithmetic" subdirectory of the HOL Light repository
