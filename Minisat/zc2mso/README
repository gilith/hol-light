zc2mso.C contains code to translate proofs produced by zChaff to the proof
format used by MiniSat 1.14p.

To compile zChaff:
==================

You need to make two changes to the zChaff source file "zchaff_solver.cpp"
before the usual "make". (This is based on zchaff.2004.11.15, but will
probably be the same or very similar in other versions.)

1. Uncomment (remove "//" from) the following line (about line 48)

   #define VERIFY_ON

2. Change the filename around line 51 from "resolve_trace" to 
   "/tmp/resolve_trace", so it becomes:

   ofstream verify_out("/tmp/resolve_trace");

These will, respectively, make zChaff record a proof, and make it
leave this proof in /tmp/resolve_trace instead of whatever the current
directory is.

To compile zc2mso:
==================

Put zc2mso.C in some dir. Put symbolic links to (or copy) the following files
from the Minisat 1.14p sources in the same dir:

File.C
File.h
Global.h
Proof.C
Proof.h
SolverTypes.h
Sort.h

Make sure zlib is installed on your system. Do:

g++ -O3 File.C Proof.C zc2mso.C -lz -o zc2mso

To use:
=======
./zc2mso input_DIMACS_problem.cnf -z input_zChaff_trace -m output_minisat_proof [-c]

The -c option will invoke a (slow) proof checker after translating. This also
reports the total number of resolutions in the output proof.

To use from within HOL Light:
=============================

First read ../README.

Use the function ZSAT_TAUT_PROVE, which has exactly the same semantics as
SAT_TAUT_PROVE, except that zChaff is invoked instead of Minisat, and an
automatic zc2mso invocation is added on.

The dir containing the zc2mso binary needs to be in the current path. The
zchaff binary or a link to it (with zChaff compiled with proof production
enabled) should be in the dir pointed to by the satdir variable defined on line
63 of ../Minisat/satTools.ml.

Notes:
======
1) The output proof contains all the initial causes but only the participating
   chains.
2) If "output_minisat_proof" already exists then the translator runs but
   in the end silently refuses to overwrite it.
3) The DIMACS parser and proof checker are copied from the Minisat 1.14p
   sources. Copyright notice included in zc2mso.C.
