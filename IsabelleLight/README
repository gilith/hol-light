This README contains some brief information on the usage of this system.
Please refer to the paper [1] for a general description as well as the comments 
in the code for details on each available function. 


HOW TO LOAD:
------------

loads "IsabelleLight/make.ml";;



LIST OF FILES:
--------------

make.ml        : HOL Light style makefile with some examples.
isalight.ml    : Main loader.
support.ml     : Support functions and various shortcuts.
new_tactics.ml : Various tactics to facilitate procedural-style users.
meta_rules.ml  : Main emulation of Isabelle's natural deduction rules and tactics.



BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS AND TACTICS:
(refer to the comments in the files for more information)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

e_all tac             : Same as "e" but applies tactic tac to all subgoals.
ROTATE_TAC            : Rotates the assumptions once.
ROTATE_N_TAC n        : Rotates the assumptions n times.


DRULE_N_TAC n rule    : Applies rule to nth assumption and deletes it.
FRULE_N_TAC n rule    : Applies rule to nth assumption and adds result as a new
                        assumption.
FRULE_MN_TAC m n rule : Applies rule (such as MP) on mth and nth assumptions.


REWRITE_ASM_TAC thl   : Rewrites assumptions. PURE_, ONCE_ and PURE_ONCE_
                        versions also available.
FULL_REWRITE_TAC thl  : Rewrites assumptions then goal.
FULL_SIMP_TAC thl     : SIMP_TAC then FULL_REWRITE_TAC.


X_MATCH_CHOOSE_TAC tm : X_CHOOSE_TAC with type matching.
