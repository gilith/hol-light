readable.ml is a miz3-type interface for HOL Light tactics proofs
allowing full use of REWRITE_TAC and other thm list -> tactics.  All
the HOL Light code below is written using readable.ml, except for
from_topology.ml, which is a subset of John Harrison's code.

HilbertAxiom_read.ml is a formalization of the plane geometry part of
the Hilbert axiomatic geometry paper
http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf

inverse_bug_puzzle_read.ml is a formalization partly due to John
Harrison of a theorem due to Tom Hales explained at the end of sec
10.1 "The bug puzzle" of the HOL Light tutorial.

UniversalPropCartProd.ml defines FunctionSpace and FunctionComposition
so that Cartesian product satisfies the usual universal property.

Topology.ml is an in-progress port of the point-set topology in
Multivariate/topology.ml, changing the definition of a topological
space and the use of subtopology theorems.

from_topology.ml is a subset of Multivariate/topology.ml which run
after Topology.ml is loaded, in spite of the above "low-level"
changes, upholding the principle of data abstraction.

TarskiAxiomGeometry_read.ml is a partial formalization of
Schwabhäuser's theorem that Tarski's plane geometry axioms imply
Hilbert's, basically done up through Gupta's theorem.  Julien Narboux
has completely formalized Schwabhäuser's theorem in Coq.  Adam
Grabowski Jesse Alama improved my original Mizar Tarski code and
published it in MML.

thmTopology is a list of the theorems of Topology.ml.

thmHilbertAxiom is a list of the theorems of HilbertAxiom_read.ml.

error-checking.ml shows the error messages displayed by readable.ml.

miz3 contains the original miz3 version of HilbertAxiom_read.ml, an
emacs file for handling math characters and some miz3 documentation.
