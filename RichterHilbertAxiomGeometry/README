readable.ml is a miz3-type interface for HOL Light tactics proofs
allowing full use of REWRITE_TAC and other thm list -> tactics.

HilbertAxiom_read.ml, which uses readable.ml, is a formalization of
the plane geometry part of the Hilbert axiomatic geometry paper
http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf

inverse_bug_puzzle_read.ml, which uses readable.ml, is a formalization
partly due to John Harrison of a theorem due to Tom Hales explained at
the end of sec 10.1 "The bug puzzle" of the HOL Light tutorial.

thmFontHilbertAxiom.ml is a list, with mathematical characters, of the
theorems and definitions of HilbertAxiom_read.ml.

error-checking.ml shows the error messages displayed by readable.ml.

UniversalPropCartProd.ml defines FunctionSpace and FunctionComposition
so that Cartesian product satisfies the usual universal property.

miz3 contains the original miz3 version of HilbertAxiom_read.ml,
together with some emacs support files and miz3 documentation.
