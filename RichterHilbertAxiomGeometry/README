HilbertAxiom.ml is a formalization of the plane geometry part of the
Hilbert axiomatic geometry paper (i.e. up through sec 7)
http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf in the proof
assistant HOL Light running in ocaml and using miz3 for Mizar-like
mathematically readable proofs.  The simplest way to run
HilbertAxiom.ml is this.  

`In a terminal window (or Emacs shell), move to your hol_light directory and paste in
these 3 commands, followed by a RETURN:
ocaml
#use "hol.ml";;
#use "RichterHilbertAxiomGeometry/make.ml";;

You will see 190 or so definitions and proved theorems, in perhaps 15
minutes.  Miz3Tips gives more details on running HilbertAxiom.ml, and
is an in-progress description of how to use miz3.

FontHilbertAxiom.ml is a version of HilbertAxiom.ml written with
mathematical characters
⇒, ⇔, ¬, ∨, ∧, ∀, ∃, ⊂, ∈, ∪, ∩ and ∅
which the proof assistant Isabelle uses.  FontHilbertAxiom.ml requires 

hol-light-fonts.el, an Emacs Lisp file that when loaded defines the
function File-remove-math-fonts-for-HOL-Light which replaces the
mathematical characters symbols above with the HOL Light versions 
==>, <=>, ~, \/, /\, !, ?, SUBSET, IN, UNION, INTER and {} 
so that the revised file, now the X-selection, can be pasted into an
ocaml/HOL Light/miz3 process.  More details are in hol-light-fonts.el.

thmFontHilbertAxiom.ml is a list, with mathematical characters, of the
theorems and definitions of HilbertAxiom.ml.
