HilbertAxiom.ml is an in-progress formalization of the Hilbert
axiomatic geometry paper (basically up through sec 5)
http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf 
in the proof assistant HOL Light running in ocaml and using miz3 for
Mizar-like mathematically readable proofs.

Miz3Tips explains how to run HilbertAxiom.ml, and is an in-progress
description of how to use miz3.

FontHilbertAxiom.ml is a version of HilbertAxiom.ml written with
mathematical characters
⇒, ⇔, ¬, ∨, ∧, ∀, ∃, ⊂, ∈, ∪, ∩ and ∅
which the proof assistant Isabelle uses.  FontHilbertAxiom.ml requires 

hol-light-fonts.el, an Emacs Lisp file that when loaded defines the
function File-remove-math-fonts-for-HOL-Light which replaces the
mathematical characters symbols above with the HOL Light versions 
==>, <=>, ~, \/, /\, !, ?, SUBSET, IN, UNION, INTER and {} 
so that the revised file, now the X-selection, can be pasted into an
ocaml/HOL Light/miz3 process.  More details are in hol-light-fonts.el.

thmFontHilbertAxiom.ml is a list, with mathematical characters, of the
theorems and definitions of HilbertAxiom.ml.
