readable.ml is a miz3-type interface for HOL Light tactics proofs
allowing full use of REWRITE_TAC and other thm list -> tactics.

HilbertAxiom_read.ml, which uses readable.ml, is a formalization of
the plane geometry part of the Hilbert axiomatic geometry paper
http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf

inverse_bug_puzzle_read.ml, which uses readable.ml, is a formalization
partly due to John Harrison of a theorem due to Tom Hales explained at
the end of sec 10.1 "The bug puzzle" of the HOL Light tutorial.

UniversalPropCartProd.ml defines FunctionSpace and FunctionComposition
so that Cartesian product satisfies the usual universal property.

Topology.ml is an in-progress readable.ml port of the point-set
topology in Multivariate/topology.ml, changing the definition of a
topological space and the use of subtopology theorems.

from_topology.ml is a subset of Multivariate/topology.ml which run
after Topology.ml is loaded, in spite of the above "low-level"
changes, upholding the principle of data abstraction.

thmTopology is a list of the theorems of Topology.ml.

thmHilbertAxiom is a list of the theorems of HilbertAxiom_read.ml.

error-checking.ml shows the error messages displayed by readable.ml.

miz3 contains the original miz3 version of HilbertAxiom_read.ml, an
emacs file for handling math characters and some miz3 documentation.
