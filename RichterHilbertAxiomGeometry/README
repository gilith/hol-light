readable.ml is a miz3-type interface for HOL Light tactics proofs
allowing REWRITE_TAC (and other thmlist->tactics), MP_TAC, SPECL,
GSYM, ARITH_RULE and MESON.  Four examples illustrate usage.

HilbertAxiom_read.ml formalizes the Hilbert axiomatic geometry paper
http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf

inverse_bug_puzzle_read.ml, joint with John Harrison, formalizes Tom
Hales's theorem of sec 10.1 The bug puzzle of the HOL Light tutorial.

thmFontHilbertAxiom.ml is a list, with mathematical characters, of the
theorems and definitions of HilbertAxiom_read.ml.

UniversalPropCartProd.ml defines FunctionSpace and FunctionComposition
so that Cartesian product satisfies the usual universal property.

miz3 contains the original miz3 version of HilbertAxiom_read.ml,
together with some emacs support files and miz3 documentation.
