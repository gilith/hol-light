readable.ml is a miz3-type interface for HOL Light tactics proofs.

HilbertAxiom_read.ml, which uses readable.ml, is a formalization of
the plane geometry part of the Hilbert axiomatic geometry paper
http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~richter/hilbert.pdf

inverse_bug_puzzle_read.ml, which uses readable.ml, is a formalization
partly due to John Harrison of a theorem due to Tom Hales explained at
the end of sec 10.1 "The bug puzzle" of the HOL Light tutorial.

thmFontHilbertAxiom.ml is a list, with mathematical characters, of the
theorems and definitions of HilbertAxiom_read.ml

HilbertAxiom.ml is an earlier formalization of hilbert.pdf using miz3.

Miz3Tips gives details on running HilbertAxiom.ml, and some
information on how to use miz3.

FontHilbertAxiom.ml is a version of HilbertAxiom.ml written with
mathematical characters
⇒, ⇔, ¬, ∨, ∧, ∀, ∃, ⊂, ∈, ∪, ∩ and ∅
which HOL4, Isabelle and readable.ml allow.  It requires 

hol-light-fonts.el is needed to run the miz3 code FontHilbertAxiom.ml.
hol-light-fonts.elc is the byte-compiled version of the Emacs code.

make.ml is an easy way to run the miz3 code HilbertAxiom.ml:
#use "RichterHilbertAxiomGeometry/make.ml";;
