This code implements and extends for HOL Light some of the classic
techniques due to Boyer and Moore for automating inductive proofs. It
is described in the MSc thesis "On the Automation of Inductive Proofs
in HOL Light", available online:

  http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/publications/thesis/online/IM070466.pdf

The code builds on earlier work by Richard Boulton in HOL88 (see
"Boyer-Moore automation for the HOL System").
